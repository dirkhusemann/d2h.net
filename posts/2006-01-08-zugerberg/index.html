<div><p>it’s sunday…yesterday we attended a <a href=http://emknews.umc-europe.org/2005/dezember/29-01.php>full day workshop on “aufatmen
und frei sein”</a> (roughly translated as “breath again and
be free”) which was organized by the united methodist church of
switzerland and took place in zurich. it was rather refreshing and
provided lots of encouragement not only to take a positive, christian
view of the world but also to try and make a difference in other
people’s lives. the workshop was done by robert seitz (contributing
excellent texts, giving much food for thought) and <a href=http://www.fankhauser.de/christof/>christof
fankhauser</a> (accentuating and amplifying seitz’s texts through
his musical meditations and songs). excellent stuff.</p>
<p>today, we are off to take a winter walk. originally i wanted to take a
walk on <a href=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigi>top of rigi</a> — to which my beloved wife objects on
the grounds that it takes <em>too</em> long to get there…hmm…the argument
that there’s a very pleasant boat ride from lucerne to vitznau
included somehow does not find a lot of purchase — instead an
alternative is proposed: <a href=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugerberg>zugerberg.</a> at first i’m quite
sceptical. “zugerberg” sounds like a lot like <a href=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uetliberg>“üetliberg”, the
favourite local mountain of all of zurich</a> (with good
weather up on üetliberg and bad weather down in zurich, that is quite
often in winter, you almost have to queue to take a walk)…but: it
only takes 1 hour 10min to get there by public transport. as my wife
(as always :-) has a point about the travel time required to get on
top of rigi, we finally agree on zugerberg.</p>
<p>so, after a nice sunday morning breakfast we take the train at 10:55
to sihlbrugg, change into the train from zurich to zug, take a local
bus up to the ground station of the <a href=http://www.zbb.ch/ title="utterly broken website...">zugerberg funicular railway</a>
and then the funicular railway up the mountain. while it’s all grey in
grey down in the plain, once we pass the 900m mark we break through to
the sun! up at the mountain station we have a fantastic view across
the alps, with pilatus to our right, followed by rigi and a bunch of
other mountains (sorry, pilatus & rigi are about the only ones i can
identify — unlike mr r who knows the silhouette of <em>every</em> swiss
mountain from any direction at any time of day).</p>
<p>we take the large walk combining winter walks #2, #3, and #4 into one
long walk. quite a number of people are up here, but it’s not crowded
yet. part of the high plateau up zugerberg consists of moor land: and
the vegetation looks rather like the moor land of northern germany
transplanted to the alps! cool! :-)</p>
<p>all in all a very nice day — thanks to dorothee!</p>
