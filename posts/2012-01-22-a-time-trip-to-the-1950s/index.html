even though the place we live at here in switzerland has a rather rural character — there are several livestock markets throughout the year down at the station square, very few regions regularly vote more conservative than ours — <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsiedeln>einsiedeln</a> has a surprising cultural live. one of the driving forces is the <a href=http://chaernehus.ch/>chaernehus</a>, which several times a year hosts cabaret, an exhibition, and stages a play.</p>
<p><a href=http://d2h.net/stuff/IMG_20120121_212743.jpg><img src=http://d2h.net/stuff/IMG_20120121_212743-127x494.jpg alt title=IMG_20120121_212743></a>this year’s play is <a href="http://www.chaernehus.ch/index.php?id=31&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=192&tx_ttnews%5Byear%5D=2011&tx_ttnews%5Bmonth%5D=12&tx_ttnews%5Bday%5D=28&cHash=578ff719d2"><em>kino etzel</em></a> — which <a href=https://twitter.com/#!/jmdhh>@jmdhh</a> and i went to see tonight. <em>kino etzel</em> is played in the old cinema, <em>kino etzel</em> and is a tribute to the old swiss rural cinema of the 1950s. until the of 2010 einsiedeln’s kino etzel was still operating and it had been lovingly kept in the style of the 1950s — i loved it. unfortunately, the end of 2010 was also the last curtain for kino etzel — until this year when the chaernehus theater group decided to make it the subject of their 2012 production.</p>
<p>we had made seat reservations and when we arrived at 20:00 were greeted by cloakroom attendants in 1950s outfit — the price to leave our coats was 1950s as well: CHF 0.20 (tickets were 2012-ish price-wise though <img src=http://d2h.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif alt=;-)> we had not only reserved seats in the show but also in the pre-show restaurant: the gallery had been turned into a typical 1950s swiss restaurant complete with a <a href=http://www.chaernehus.ch/fileadmin/data/Theater/Menuekarte_EtzelStuebli.pdf>1950s swiss menu</a>, lovingly decorated with furnishings from that era. due to running a bit late but still had time to have an <a href=http://www.einsiedlerbier.ch/einsiedlerbier.php>einsiedler beer</a> and something to eat before the show started.</p>
<p>the play itself is a mixture of cinematic, theatrical, and musical elements — sometimes intermixed (the initial showing of a piece from the 1950s schweizer wochenschau about the bad wolf in wallis<a href=#fn:1>1</a> was aborted by two 1950s policemen storming the cinema and reading out the regulations of the canton of schwyz regarding cabaret shows. all elements of the play work together to re-create the 1950s — and for most of the show it works quite well (the football piece was a bit drawn out and trying to imitate <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicco_von_B%C3%BClow>loriot</a> but not quite achieving that really).</p>
<p>all in all: a very entertaining and interesting show, well worth a visit!</p>
