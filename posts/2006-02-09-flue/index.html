<div><p>since monday afternoon i’m in bed with flu. not particularly
pleasant. fever wouldn’t retreat really until yesterday evening. went
to see my very <a href=http://www.praxislandolt.ch/>capable physician</a> yesterday who did a very
thorough check including a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein>CRP blood test</a>,
all in all, revealing that i was probably suffering from a viral
infection but on the way back to the living again. he told me to stay
at home until friday (which i’m doing).</p>
<p>since monday i had ample opportunity to compare the results of my
assortment of thermometers: i’ve accumulated over the years</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-in-glass_thermometer>mercury-in-glass thermometer</a></li>
<li>a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer>digital thermometer</a> in the same form factor
as the mercury-in-glass thermometer (and used in the same way)</li>
<li>a digital in-ear thermometer (whose head you poke into your ear
canal)</li>
<li>and yet another digital thermometer, this on to place on your
forehead</li>
</ul>
<p>it turns out that the mercury-in-glass thermometer and the digital
thermometer are the most reliable. the other two thermometers produce
widely varying readings depending on the angle you poke it into the
ear (in ear thermometer) or depending on where exactly on your
forehead you place the forehead thermometer — and the trouble is
your are unlikely to be able to repeat the next measurement with the
same level of accuracy: trying to get two consistent readings in a row
with either the forehead or the in-ear thermometer proved next to
impossible. both would often report my body temperature as 35.6°C or
some other bogus value when both the mercury-in-glass and digital
thermometer would tell me that i’d have 38.1°C…</p>
<p>the best one in my opinion is the digital thermometer that replaced
the mercury-in-glass ones: it works under the tongue (as does the
mercury-in-glass one) but is faster to take the reading: within 90secs
you’ve got a reading of the state of the nation (and it beeps a couple
of times to alert you that it’s finished taking the reading). the
mercury-in-glass has the advantage of being completely analogue and
not requiring any batteries, but has the drawback of taking quite a
long time (up to 10mins until the temperature had stabilised in some
cases).</p>
<p>so, now you know what computer scientists do when they are bed-ridden
with the flu…</p>
