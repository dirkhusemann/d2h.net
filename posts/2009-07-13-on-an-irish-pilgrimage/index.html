<div><p>the next 10 days we are taking part in a <em>spiritual journey through
ireland</em>. really kind of a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrimage>pilgrimage</a>, a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_pilgrimage>christian pilgrimage</a> to be precise, by bus (not a lot of walking involved, unfortunately) to the places of the old, celtic irish church. the whole trip has been organized by the <a href=http://www.akademie-st-paul.org/>akademie st. paul</a> — and
it’s the first group trip of this kind that i’ve ever participated in
and i’m not too sure whether it’s going to be to my liking. let’s
see.</p>
<p>starting point is <em>dublin airport</em> which we reach by way of —- yes,
unfortunately — plane <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif alt=:-(> to catch the 9:20 swiss flight from zurich
to dublin, we take the 6:59 train from einsiedeln, necessitating
getting up at 5:00, sigh. we make it in time and get to zurich
airport, manage to get our failed web-check-in sorted<a href=#fn:7417072c5d466e1849b4fab3f41ba6341>1</a>, even manage
to get two seats next to one another<a href=#fn:7417072c5d466e1849b4fab3f41ba6342>2</a> — and have a punctual and
fairly calm flight (big relief on my part).</p>
<p>we are the first part of the group to arrive in dublin. once we’ve had
a coffee (me) and smoothie (mrs d) we position ourselves directly
opposite the arrivals area and hold up our sign and wait…</p>
<p>and wait…<a href=#fn:7417072c5d466e1849b4fab3f41ba6343>3</a></p>
<p>and wait. finally at around 12:30 the first few folks of the remainder
of our group trickle in and by 13:30 we are almost complete. it’s an,
err, interesting mixture. our bus driver for the next 10 days collects
us and after a small problem with luggage (luckily quickly resolved)
we are on our way into dublin city center.</p>
<p>our pilgrimage’s guide, mr tambour from akademie st paul, evidently
has done his homework and gives us a rather well-informed running
commentary of the stuff we see already from the bus, and, once we are
ground-bourne again, a tour of the temple bar district and, the
highlight of the afternoon: <em>christ church</em>.</p>
<p>i’m not sure whether i’m cut out for this group travel stuff — i
find that i need time for myself and, also, that i actually enjoy the
immersive part of travelling alone (that is, either really alone or
together with mrs d) and being forced to interact with the “natives”
(so to speak) and take part (at least to some extent) in the culture
that surrounds us. travelling in a group of germans takes that part
away, it’s like travelling in a shell, in a bubble, a bit isolated
from the country you want to experience.</p>
<p>we get to our hotel, the <a href=http://www.standhousehotel.com/><em>stand house hotel</em></a> by a 18:20 and have a bit of time to settle in (we are going to stay two nights here), then it’s a rather nice dinner followed by some blogging <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)></p>
<p>let’s see how this all works out <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)></p>

<li>the swiss international air lines web-check-in took us through
all the stages of the check-in process and then refused to display
the boarding cards. hmph. <a href=#fnref:7417072c5d466e1849b4fab3f41ba6341>↩</a></li>
<li>which the aforementioned web-check-in also refused to do. <a href=#fnref:7417072c5d466e1849b4fab3f41ba6342>↩</a></li>
<li>i do notice that some folks have rather interesting signs: “his
royal highness”, for example. perhaps i should try my private twitter
moniker, dr who, next time i’m being picked up<a href=#fn:7417072c5d466e1849b4fab3f41ba6344>4</a>? <a href=#fnref:7417072c5d466e1849b4fab3f41ba6343>↩</a></li>
<li>yes, however unlikely that may be. <a href=#fnref:7417072c5d466e1849b4fab3f41ba6344>↩</a></li>
