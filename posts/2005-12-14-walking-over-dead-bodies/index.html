<div><p>quite sad <a href=http://www.guardian.co.uk/frontpage/story/0,,1666899,00.html>to read about the execution of tookie william</a>
last night. the common view by commentators seems to be that
california’s governor, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger>arnold schwarzenegger</a>,
did not grant clemency because of not wanting to his republican
clientel to appear soft on crime — and in particular wanted to boost
his image after having lost several referendums and elections in the
last months.</p>
<p>mr william has been in prison for such a long time that in other,
civilized, countries he’d have served a life sentence already. from
what is reported of mr william, he seems to have done a 180°
turn-around from his criminal past, has been instrumental in resolving
gang wars in as far away places as new york, has been writing books
for kids and teenagers in which he delivers a very strong message
against joining gangs.</p>
<p>mr schwarzenegger nevertheless decided not to pardon mr william —
mainly on the grounds that tookie william never regretted the crimes
he’d been sentenced to death for. now, the reason why mr william
didn’t apologized for those crimes is that he’s maintained since
before his trial that he did not commit those crimes.</p>
<p>so, to get this straight: there is a man sentenced to death, sitting
in death row for the most part of his life, has done a very convincing
and effective 180° turn-around from his criminal past (has to all
intents, facts, and purposes repented) and has always maintained his
innocence about the crimes he’s been accused of — denying clemency
on the grounds of him having never apologized for the crimes he is
alleged to have committed is a rather arrogant and presumptuous
position. arrogant and presumptuous because it assumes that that
judgement was a correct and just judgement and it fails to acknowledge
the history of wrongly assigned sentences and, even worse, death
sentences.</p>
<p>in my opinion mr schwarzenegger literally walks over dead bodies to
further his own “career” — and certainly is not man enough to grant
a pardon to mr william. if you ask me: a rather wimpy terminator…</p>
