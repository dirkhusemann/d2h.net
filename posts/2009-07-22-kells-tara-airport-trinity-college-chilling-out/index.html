<div><p>the last day of our irish pilgrimage! after another good breakfast at
the <a href=http://www.newgrangehotel.ie/>newgrange hotel</a> we pack once more and enter our pilgrims bus
— which this morning has grown in size: morris, our excellent
driver, swapped our smaller bus yesterday evening for a bigger one as
he’s going to pick up a group of 50 at dublin airport right after
dropping us off.</p>
<p>the final “building blocks” of our pilgrimage are <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kells,_County_Meath>kells</a> and
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_of_Tara>the hill of tara</a>.</p>
<p>after a short ride we get to the little town of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kells,_County_Meath>kells</a> and
disembark. first stop: the large celtic cross that used to stand in
the middle of a busy crossroads but has now been relocated a little
outside the town center. it’s been damaged — whether that damage
originates with that unlucky encounter with that “cumbersome
schoolbus”<a href=#fn:2bbfaa21a24575eb7591685ec6e18adb1>1</a> or has been inflicted earlier is hard to tell — but
still interesting nevertheless.</p>
<p>from the cross we make our way up to the site of what used to be the
monastery of kells and is now a normal church — a church with four
high crosses and a replica of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_kells>book of kells</a>, though!</p>
<p>next and last pilgrimage stop: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_of_Tara>the hill of tara</a> — another site
close to the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Boyne>river boyne</a>. legend has it that tara was the seat of
the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_King_of_Ireland>high king of ireland</a>, the <em>árd rí na héireann.</em> was is known
as fact is that the hill of tara was the site of iron age hilltop
enclosure as well as the site of a neolithic passage grave. the hill
itself offers a nice view across county meath (including slane which
we visited yesterday). its other prominent features are a tea room and
two (2) souvenir shops…</p>
<p>the visit to tara concludes our pilgrimage, our next and final stop is
dublin airport with most of our co-pilgrims flying back to frankfurt
and düsseldorf in the afternoon, and with mrs d and i taking the
aircoach bus into dublin as our flight back to zurich will not leave
until tomorrow.</p>
<p>dublin airport is busy, and we just have moments to grab our luggage,
say our “goodbyes” and then we are all of a sudden by ourselves
again. after some initial trouble we manage to find the aircoach bus
stop, buy a return ticket and are soon on our way into dublin city
center. the ride takes about 40min (longer than the first time when we
used that tunnel which the aircoach buses don’t).</p>
<p>our hotel, the <em><a href=http://www.ocallaghanhotels.com/dublinmain/davenport.aspx>o’callaghan davenport hotel</a></em> is right around the
corner of the <em>marrion square north</em> aircoach bus stop. the room is OK
and we just drop our luggage off and make our way to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Dublin>trinity
college</a> to visit the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_kells>book of kells</a> exhibition.</p>
<p>we are, not surprisingly, not alone in our quest, lots of tourists
(american but also german) along with bus loads of school kids. we
manage to squeeze in and slowly make our way through the very
interesting exhibition explaining the background of the book of kells
but also how it probably was created. fascinating and well worth the
money. also, a very nice closure of our pilgrimage <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)></p>
<p>the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Dublin#The_Library_and_culture>library’s long room</a> is nice but nothing to get really excited
about: it’s a typical old library. i had hoped for more trinity
college or even ireland related material to be on display but instead
get treated to an exhibition about napoleon bonaparte. hmph.</p>
<p>after the cultural part we are in dire need of a tea and something to
eat. following the recommendation of ms p we follow the signs in
grafton street for the <em><a href=http://goireland.about.com/od/shopping/gr/powerscourt_th.htm>powerscourt</a></em> shopping center where we have
a very nice “high tea” in the old courtyard — any thoughts on
returning for dinner are kind of squashed when around 17:15 the staff
of the café start collecting the menu cards and closing down. on
leaving we find out that 18:00 is closing time — worse than germany
in the bad old days of the <em>ladenschlußgesetz!</em> and this is the
capital or ireland!</p>
<p>our walk back to the hotel is interrupted and severely cut short by
the onset of very heavy rain. luckily we do have our umbrellas with us,
but by the time we reach our hotel we are still a bit wet.</p>
<p>being tired all of a sudden (anti-climax?) we decide to stay at the
hotel for the evening and conclude our ireland adventure with a couple
of pints of cidre and guinness in the hotel bar.</p>

<p>The other Celtic cross was positioned in the middle of a busy
crossroads until an unfortunate accident involving a
cumbersome school bus. It now stands in front of a former
courthouse, now a museum and coffeeshop. A roof protects the
cross from the elements. Curiously, a replica is completely
safe from the elements inside the museum.</p>
