<div><p>mrs d and i slept surprisingly well this night, given the fact that
one of the main thorough-fares passes the hotel just a couple of
meters away.<a href=#fn:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a1>1</a> breakfast is efficient and good and the waitresses
are actually quite friendly and even know about gluten-free food for
mrs j.<a href=#fn:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a2>2</a></p>
<p>the weather has become rather irish: it’s raining when we set off for
a walk in the boyne valley, and it’s treating us to several showers on
the otherwise rather <em>pittoresque</em> walk. in contrast to the previous
walks we are to go by ourselves in silence and since we return to the
bus mrs d and i for once can walk as it pleases us instead of forming
the tail-end. rather quickly the whole group disperses over the length
of the path, and i rather enjoy the quietude and the breathtaking
scenery.<a href=#fn:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a3>3</a></p>
<p>next stop is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange>newgrange</a>, or rather the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%BA_na_B%C3%B3inne_Visitor_Centre>brú na bóinne visitor
centre</a> and the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowth>knowth</a> neolithic passage grave. mrs dr, who has
so far been doing a fantastic job translating for our non-english
speaking co-pilgrims, unfortunately is under the weather today and mr
tambour inquires whether i could be of assistance. i agree on
condition that i can make things up if i loose the plot — to which
he laughingly agrees. so, to cut a long story short: i learn quite a
bit about knowth and its history through the milleniums — our group is
a bit surprised to learn that knowth and the other mounds nearby are
in fact modelled after what science assumes to be advanced flying
objects and probably served as intergalactic beacons similar to the
lighthouses of the 19th and 20th century…</p>
<p>…ok, ok, just kidding <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif alt=:-D> i try my best to translate everything<a href=#fn:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a4>4</a>
and seem to get the job done in a half-decent way.<a href=#fn:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a5>5</a> knowth is the
largest passage grave site in the area and even contains over one
third of all <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalithic_art>megalithic art</a> in all western europe! it’s also quite
special in that <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowth#History>several different cultures made use of it through the
milleniums.</a> fascinating stuff. as is the fact that
knowth predates the pyramids by about 500 years! i quite enjoy the
visit to knowth and the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%BA_na_B%C3%B3inne_Visitor_Centre>brú na bóinne visitor centre</a> and am quite
impressed by it.</p>
<p>after lunch at the visitor center we are on our way once more — the
weather is becoming increasingly more friendly — and, with a short
stop at the site of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Boyne>battle of the boyne</a>, visit <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monasterboice>monasterboice</a>
and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slane#The_Hill_of_Slane>the hill of slane</a>.</p>
<p>monasterboice is most famous for its <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_cross>high crosses</a> and has a couple
of rather well-preserved specimen. it’s also a “living” grave-yard:
“living” in the sense that it’s still in use today.</p>
<p>the last stop today is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slane#The_Hill_of_Slane>the hill of slane</a> where <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Patrick>st patrick</a>
supposedly lit the first easter fire. today it’s a ruined church with
a churchyard and no fire — but lots of rain all of a sudden gushing
down on us and we rather hastily beat a retreat to our waiting bus.</p>
<p>all in all a rather interesting day, knowth impressed me the most,
i’ve to say.<a href=#fn:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a6>6</a></p>

<li>perhaps we got lucky that our room is behind a wall shielding us
from the traffic noise. <a href=#fnref:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a1>↩</a></li>
<li>having translated for mrs j a number of times when she tried to
explain to the various waiters and waitresses what gluten-free
means, i’m slowly becoming an expert on that topic — well,
almost <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)>  <a href=#fnref:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a2>↩</a></li>
<li>which reminds me in places of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Beauly>river beauly</a> which <a href=http://50mm-traveller.net/2003/2003-05-21%20scotland/dscn1427-c.jpg.php>we
visited in 2003</a> <a href=#fnref:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a3>↩</a></li>
<li>but stumble over <em>horse shoe</em> which i translate a bit too
literally as <em>pferdeschuh</em>, which mr tambour, enthusiastic
equestrian that he is, promptly corrects to <em>hufeisen</em> — oh,
well, i never claimed to be an expert in horses… <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)>  <a href=#fnref:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a4>↩</a></li>
<li>no tips, though. hmmm, guess i’ve to work on those skills a bit
then… <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif alt=:-D>  <a href=#fnref:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a5>↩</a></li>
<li>a little voice in my head mumbles that i probably was so
impressed by it because for once i had to concentrate on what
was being said. hmph. <a href=#fnref:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a6>↩</a></li>
