<div><p>it’s sunday. our last night at the <em>ballygarry house hotel</em> was quiet
for a change, which is nice. also, as long as our group is having
breakfast, we are spared the rather annoying radio blast.<a href=#fn:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de291>1</a></p>
<p>after breakfast mrs d and i pack our stuff and join the rest of the
pilgrims in our pilgrims bus. the first stop today is in <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listowel>listowel</a>
— apparently the literary capital of ireland. our stop is short: mr
tambour, our pilgrimage guide, as always, is extremely well prepared
and we learn quite a bit about listowel and its literary sons and
daughters — but also take a look at listowel’s racetrack <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)> during
the bus ride from tralee to listowel a co-pilgrim mentioned that
apparently writers with a residence in ireland would live tax-free:
might that explain the relatively high percentage of writers in
relation to the total population? oh, one other thing that’s worth
mentioning about listowel: the pedestrian crossing at the newsagents
on the main square has an absolutely cool sounding free-to-walk
alarm…</p>
<p>it’s a short stop only as we need to catch the 10:00 <a href=http://www.shannonferries.com/>ferry</a> from
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarbert,_County_Kerry>tarbert</a> across the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Shannon>river shannon</a> and after 20min or so we are
on our way again.</p>
<p>the ferry across the river shannon is a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry#Double-ended>double-ended, open top type
of ferry</a> with integral ramps which just drop down to the concrete
ferry slips. we do make it to tarbert with about 10min to spare and
take the opportunity to have a look across the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Estuary>shannon
estuary</a>. the crossing itself is fairly eventless (ignoring that
strong shower just before we reach the other side of the river
shannon) and we are soon on our way through county clare to
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahinch>lahinch</a> with a short stop at <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilkee>kilkee</a> to have a look at <em>kilkee
cliffs</em>.</p>
<p><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahinch>lahinch</a> means lunch-time! we get dropped off at the sea promenade
and mrs d and i do find a nice pub-cum-restaurant, the <a href=http://www.shamrockinn.ie/>shamrock
inn</a> where we have a rather nice little lunch. it’s a popular place
with the locals it seems and service is very friendly and prompt. the
food is excellent (as is my pint of guinness <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)> )</p>
<p>at about 14:00 we reconvene at our pilgrims’s bus and are off
again. next stop: <em>brigid’s well</em> — yep, there’s another one<img src=#fn:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de296 alt=2>
this one, in contrast to the other wells we’ve seen so far, is located
directly next to the main road and sits to the side of a pub and below
a cemetery. interesting combination that. the highlight of our visit
is another story by our master story teller, ms k, about the celtic
goddess brigid.</p>
<p>of the three places, cemetery, well, and pub, we unfortunately only
get to see the well and are soon on our way again to the <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffs_of_moher>cliffs of
moher</a></em>!</p>
<p>now, the cliffs of moher: a name that seems to have jumped right of
the pages of <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit>the hobbit</a></em>, conjuring up images of wild, remote,
difficult to reach cliffs…</p>
<p>well…</p>
<p>…not exactly. if there are any links to hobbit land, then it must be
the sticky spider’s web of the black forest of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirkwood>mirkwood</a> which
trapped bilbo’s dwarf companions — the cliffs of moher are one
gigantic tourist trap. the scenery is nice, what with dramatic cliffs
and views west.<a href=#fn:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de292>3</a> that is true — just don’t look at the king-sized
cafeteria, the exhibition center<a href=#fn:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de295>4</a>, and a large shopping area
selling all the kitsch ireland can throw at you — <em>plus</em> several
smaller shops (more kitsch and even more kitsch). mrs d and i speed up
to the cliff tops on either side, take a peek at the tower on the
north cliff, decide to not pay the entrance fee for the tower, and
fight our way back down to the cafeteria — the wind is blowing
strongly today — and have a cup of tea, take a look at the kitsch on
sale, and settle down to enjoy the sun.</p>
<p>from the cliffs of moher tourist trap our pilgrimage continues towards
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doolin>doolin</a>. instead of going there directly by bus, we get to do a
little walk today and approach it from <em>lough north</em>, a nice little walk
taking us through the west irish coastal scenery.</p>
<p>our hotel in doolin, <em><a href=http://www.hoteldoolin.ie/>hotel doolin</a></em>, is a newly build hotel in a
modern, contemporary style, quite nice. dinner is is the adjoining
pub–restaurant, a bit relaxed and not as speedy as the busy
<em>ballygarry house hotel</em>, but i quite like it. the food is excellent!</p>
<p>after dinner we split up into little groups and swarm out into the
scattered village of doolin to visit <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doolin#Pubs>the pubs</a> — tonight is
“irish pub night”! mrs d and i opt for the “original one”, <em>gus
o’connors</em>, founded in 1832.</p>
<p>when we arrive at about 21:45, the live music is already playing (a
bit slowly still, but picking up steam [literally] as the night
progresses). we settle in with a pint of guinness and cidre and enjoy
the music and also the chat with our co-pilgrims.</p>
<p>quite a day <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)></p>

<li>though, as soon as we are finished and leave, they <em>do</em> turn the
radio up to full blast again. <a href=#fnref:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de291>↩</a></li>
<li>here’s my theory on celtic saints: first, to be eligible for
celtic sainthood you need to have at least <em>one</em> well or spring
named after you; second, the more wells and springs you can collect
the more important, saint-wise, you are. <a href=#fnref:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de296>↩</a></li>
<li>rumor has it, that on a fine day<a href=#fn:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de293>5</a> you <em>can</em> see the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_liberty>statue of liberty</a><img src=#fn:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de294 alt=6> <a href=#fnref:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de292>↩</a></li>
<li>hosting an exhibition about the atlantic ocean when we were
there. <a href=#fnref:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de295>↩</a></li>
<li>for certain definitions of <em>fine</em>, almost all of them probably
involving larger quantities of guinness… <a href=#fnref:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de293>↩</a></li>
<li>and, yes, i just might be making this up as i go… <a href=#fnref:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de294>↩</a></li>
