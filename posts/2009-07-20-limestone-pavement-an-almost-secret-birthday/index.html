<div><p>after a rather good night and an equally good and relaxed
breakfast<a href=#fn:d409b385109aba321cf1062fc3cfa0841>1</a> at <a href=http://www.hoteldoolin.ie/>hotel doolin</a> we pack once more and embark on the
long trip across ireland, going from the atlantic west coast all the
way to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navan>navan</a>. the weather is not as good as it was yesterday with
clouds covering most of the sky.</p>
<p>we don’t just go to navan directly but instead take the scenic
route. our first stop is at <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Parks_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland>burren national park</a>,</em> the smallest
of the 6 national parks in ireland and part of the larger area <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burren>the
burren</a>:</em> a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burren>karst</a> landscape exhibiting the typical karst
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone_pavement>limestone pavement</a> and also host for a number of megalithic tombs
and portal <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolmens>dolmens</a> — rather impressive. after some time to our
own we continue through the rather barren looking landscape — mr
tambour cites <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Ludlow>edmund ludlow</a>, an english parlimentarian, who is
supposed to have said during counter-guerilla operations in
1651–1652:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a country where there is not enough water to drown a man, wood
enough to hang one, nor earth enough to bury him</p>
<p><em>— [<a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A642610>h2g2, hitchhiker&rsquo;s guide
to the galaxy</a>]<a href=#fn:d409b385109aba321cf1062fc3cfa0842>2</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>we stop at <em>burren house</em> near <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballyvaughan>ballyvaughan</a></em> for a tea, some
shopping,<a href=#fn:d409b385109aba321cf1062fc3cfa0843>3</a> and some decompression. it’s the last chance to see the
atlantic on our pilgrimage as from now on we are going to go east
again.</p>
<p>aside from a short lunch stop in one of the little towns on the way
east we stay on our pilgrimage bus until we reach the <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonmacnoise>monastery of
clonmacnoise</a></em> in the afternoon.</p>
<p>the monastery of clonmacnoise was founded by st ciaráran in 545 AD. it
was strategically located on the main east–west land route through
ireland at that time. by the 9th century it had become <em>the</em> center of
religion, learning, craftsmanship, and trade in ireland and was in
fact a european academic focal point at the time. it’s not hard to
imagine that from places like clonmacnoise western civilization was
indeed brought back to the continent (and, thus, saved) as <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cahill>thomas
cahill</a> writes in his book <em><a href=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/cahill/irish.html>how the irish saved civilization</a>.</em></p>
<p>after an audio–visual about clonmacnoise in the visitor’s center we
go and explore the ruins of the monastery.</p>
<p>it’s in the early evening when we arrive at our hotel in navan, the
<em><a href=http://www.newgrangehotel.ie/>newgrange hotel</a></em> — which despite looking rather old is
supposedly only three years old! interesting.</p>
<p>at dinner we are joined by mr kleemann, the owner of the <a href=http://www.kleemann.ie/>travel
agency</a> that arranged the hotels and our bus. it transpires
that mr kleemann is originally from <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia>franconia</a> in northern
bavaria. he seems rather excited to see us — unfortunately that
excitement doesn’t carry over to sponsoring the drinks <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif alt=:-(> oh, well,
it was worth a try <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif alt=;-)></p>
<p>after dinner we invite ms r for a pint of guinness — it’s been, after
all, my birthday <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)></p>
<p>p.s.: <em>navan</em> is a rather special city name: it’s one of the few
places having a <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_palindromic_places>palindromic name</a>!</em></p>

<li>no problems with getting coffee, no being told off for sitting
at the wrong table <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)>  <a href=#fnref:d409b385109aba321cf1062fc3cfa0841>↩</a></li>
<li>the <em>h2g2</em> entry interestingly adds:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The words of the Cromwellian general Edmund Ludlow, describing
the area known as the Burren, are well known in Ireland. What
is less well known is that he went on to say of the people
there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…and yet their cattle are very fat; for the grass growing
in turfs of earth, of two or three foot square, that lie
between the rocks, which are of limestone, is very sweet and
nourishing.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

3. i buy a very nice woollen sweater <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)>  <a href=#fnref:d409b385109aba321cf1062fc3cfa0843>↩</a></p>
