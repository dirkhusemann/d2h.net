<div><p><em>ring, ring</em> — mrs d picks up the phone, it’s the 7:15 wake-up call
and, as expected, nobody answers back. time to get up. <em>ring, ring</em>
— mrs d picks up the phone yet again, this time round it’s the bloke
from reception asking whether “madame is ok?”, madame affirms and
receives a rather charming “ok, baby”. this somewhat incongruous start
into our first day as pilgrims in ireland kind of forms the fabric of
the day: it stays incongruous, constantly changing between dry and
rather wet.</p>
<p>breakfast at the <a href=http://www.standhousehotel.com/><em>stand house hotel</em></a>
is, compared to dinner, a bit of a let down: the orange and cranberry
juice suffers from a rather high concentration of water and introduces
the gnawing suspicion that the breakfast staff have not yet grasped
the concept that orange juice concentrate should not be used to dilute
water but rather the other way round. the cooked breakfast is on the
ok side of cooked breakfasts (we’ve had worse, but we’ve also had
better), the waitress a charm that would work quite well inside a wood
workshop, taking rough edges off…</p>
<p>while the sun is still shining we leave by bus for the first part of
our pilgrimage: the <em>eurospar</em> at kilcullen (food always played an
important role on pilgrimages through the ages).</p>
<p>next, through narrow, winding roads we aim for hollywood — and miss on the first
attempt. after some tapping of local knowledge<a href=#fn:30982eb5ed749f80caa0316f3071a1641>1</a> we make it with
take 2 and, a few miles outside of hollywood, start our walking
part: we are following part of <a href="http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/recreation/heritage-council-initiatives/the-pilgrim-paths/st-kevins-way/?L=0">kevin’s way</a> in the direction of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendalough>glendalough</a>.</p>
<p>the weather has turned sour on us, and alternatively treats us
to dry and wet spells while we are still on the hard road part of the
walk. once we reach the footpath along the river, however, it’s found
its stride and just pours it out all the way to pass road for wicklow
pass. d’oh.</p>
<p>the landscape is rather nice though and it’s kind of fun walking
through the drenched scenery regardless of the rain. after about 2.5
hours we reach the pass road to wicklow pass and are rescued by our
bus. next stop: glendalough.</p>
<p>at glendalough are the rather interesting remains of the old
monasteric city. it was originally founded by <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_of_Glendalough>kevin</a> who intended
to lead a solitary life as a hermit — that plan didn’t work out too
well and kevin had to scupper it quite quickly as other folks like
that idea of leading a solitary life in that spot of ireland,
and…joined him.<a href=#fn:30982eb5ed749f80caa0316f3071a1642>2</a> a thriving community evolved around the
monasteric buildings and quickly turned from a mere dwelling into a
town.</p>
<p>what is interesting about glendalough is the way they lived a life
that did not differentiate between worldly matters and spiritual
matters but instead practised a holistic spirituality, the celtic
spirituality: god is among us, around us, above us and below us and
with us in everything we do and live — in contrast to the
continental european theology which is mostly a kind of dualistic
theology (god above in heaven, we down below on earth). there are
parallels to dietrich bonhoeffer’s view that god is not a god of the
boundaries or gaps<a href=#fn:30982eb5ed749f80caa0316f3071a1643>3</a> but instead a god in our midst (and only
makes sense as such) — a view that i’ve made my own ever since i
encountered it and, thus, am pleasantly surprised to encounter it
here again and also to learn that there is a long tradition supporting
that view.</p>
<p>after we had made our way through the (heavily visited) ruins of the
monasteric city we spent about an hour with dominican sister genevieve
who explained to us the history behind and nature of celtic
spirituality — a very fascinating hour!</p>
<p>dinner was a bit less organized than yesterday (the notion of drinks
along with food was a novelty to the two waitresses this evening, but
they quickly realized that it might indeed be a good idea), the quality of the food was good.</p>

<li>luckily, those two old men <em>did</em> know their way around, unlike
me sometime in the early 1990s in the north of jeresey when i
unintentionally mis-directed a bus full of tourists looking for
jersey airport (of which they were as far away as they could
possibly get on that island). <a href=#fnref:30982eb5ed749f80caa0316f3071a1641>↩</a></li>
<li>some folks really don’t get even simple ideas… <a href=#fnref:30982eb5ed749f80caa0316f3071a1642>↩</a></li>
<li>that is, god as our explanation for all those things we do not
understand — and as a consequence, a god that we keep pushing
further and further away from us the more we manage to explain
ourselves. <a href=#fnref:30982eb5ed749f80caa0316f3071a1643>↩</a></li>
