went out tonight to watch a movie — which in itself is rare, as we
rather watch “new” movies on DVD at home than go and sit with 50, 100,
or even 200 other people in a more or less (un)comfortable seat, with
a guaranteed tall person to come in at the last minute and take the
seat(s) in front of you.</p>
<p>what was unusual about this movie was that it was shown inside the
university church, the <a href=http://www.erlangen-evangelisch.de/Neustadt/>neustädter kirche</a>, that
it was shown using <a href=http://www.delicatessen.org/hintergrundIII.html>digital projection (not a beamer!, we were
told)</a>, and the movie itself: <a href=http://www.diegrossestille.de/english/><em>die grosse stille</em> (or
<em>into great silence</em>)</a>.</p>
<p>the movie is about the life of the monks of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthusian>carthusian
order</a> and in particular about life in the mother
abbey, the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Chartreuse>monastery of the grand chartreuse.</a> it
starts almost in silence, and we watch a carthusian monks as he
prays. the only sound we can hear is the crackling of the wood-burning
stove. eventually the screen switches to a closeup of snow-flakes
swirling outside the monastery before slowly immersing itself (and us
with it) into the carthusian life.</p>
<p><a href=http://www.diegrossestille.de/english/video/high.html>the trailer</a> is very misleading: essentially they have
just taken “action scenes” from <em>into great silence</em>. the movie itself
is very much different. there’s no commentary. there’s no musical
soundtrack, the only sounds we get to hear are the sounds of everyday
life in the monastery: monks chanting, the sounds of hair being razed
off, steps in a hallway,… a “scene” can take minutes, without much
happening.</p>
<p>this all sounds rather boring…it’s not (and i’m not the person
enjoying watching water come to the boil, not really). you have to be
able to stand silence. this movie will force you to reflect on
yourself and what you believe in, to reflect on what you think is
important and why. <em>into great silence</em> very subtly takes you by your
hand and while your still wondering what this movie is about, you are
already captured; you are already wondering what those monks are
thinking about, what they are contemplating about; you are already
taking part in a two and a half hour meditation…</p>
<p>watch it — if you are up to it.</p>
