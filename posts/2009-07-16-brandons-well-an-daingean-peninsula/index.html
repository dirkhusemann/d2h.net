<div><p>around 2:00 in the morning: a group of hotel guests from that
anniversary party very kindly let us in into their conversations they
are having in the parking lot outside the hotel entrance — for about
half an hour we get to share each and every attempt at
jokularity… much appreciated.</p>
<p>at breakfast mrs d and i commit the <em>faux pas</em> of seating ourselves at
one of the free tables as the large group table seems to be fully
occupied. we quickly get told off by an apparently unmotivated,
round-ish waitress who informs us that <em>that</em> table is needed for
“other guests”<a href=#fn:caeeade2dab5e3c19b5447a8417bca5b1>1</a> — not quite the “irish hospitality”. coffee and
tea are just that, but also seemingly rationed: we only manage to get
2 cups of each each.</p>
<p>today’s part of the pilgrimage takes us to brandon’s well<a href=#fn:caeeade2dab5e3c19b5447a8417bca5b2>2</a> which is
a bit outside tralee. the actual well itself, the water hole in the
earth, is a bit on the quiet side<a href=#fn:caeeade2dab5e3c19b5447a8417bca5b3>3</a> but otherwise a nice little area
enclosed by a dense hedge. we read a psalm, listen to some thoughts of
mr tambour on <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%205:1-15;&version=31;">john 5:1–15 (the story of the healing at lake
bethesda)</a>, and conclude with a prayer and song.</p>
<p>the next part takes us through <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingle>an daingean</a> (aka dingle) —
replenishing our proviant at the local <em>supervalu</em> [sic] (i use the
opportunity to frequent the pharmacy next to the the aforementioned
<em>supervalu</em> to acquire some midge repellent and antihistamin: those
little buggers have really taken a fancy of me, i must have about 30
midge bites on my arms, neck and head) — along the dingle
peninsula. about 2.5 hours walk from <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingle_Peninsula>slea head</a> we are released
from our pilgrimage transporter and get a chance to walk to slea
head. the weather is at its best: in contrast to the forecast of the
irish met office we have pure, unadulterated sunshine! over the ring
of kerry we can see <em>cumulus congestus</em> clouds piling up, some looking
like they are severly tempted to turn into <em>cumulus nimbus</em> clouds —
we only have rather innocent looking straits of <em>cumulus humilis</em>
clouds coming our way. perfect.</p>
<p>while on tuesday, on kevin’s way, mrs d and i sped ahead, quickly
leaving the bulk of the group behind, we decide today to stay at the
end and “bring up the rear”, so to speak. mr tambour seems strangely
relieved by that — i can’t figure out whether he’s relieved to have
experienced walkers at the rear of the group or whether he is relieved
that we are not chasing ahead again. in any case we stay back and have
a couple of quite interesting chats on the way.</p>
<p>the scenery is fantastic: in front of us the wide open sea, framed on
both sides by mountain ranges and outlying little isles and rocks,
dark clouds on the other side of the bay piling up in-lands, the sun
casting interesting cloud shadows across the almost smooth surface of
the sea. the path to slea head winds past dry-stone walls (lots of
sheep), first up then down again. about 2 hours into the walk we break
for a snack-lunch and enjoy the quiet and the views!</p>
<p>at slea head we have about an hour to ourselves which most of us spend
at the café having a crumble and a pot of tea.</p>
<p>the way back to tralee is interrupted by a story telling session at the
beach: one of our co-pilgrims is a practised story teller and really
spins an enticing piece of yarn about a bloke called mccormack, an
enchanted branch, and how he lost his wife, daughter, and son — and
regained them later. i really enjoy that bit.</p>

<li>guests who never show up during the remainder of the breakfast
time, strangely enough… <a href=#fnref:caeeade2dab5e3c19b5447a8417bca5b1>↩</a></li>
<li>i guess to qualify as a saint in ireland you must have, at
least, one well named after you. <a href=#fnref:caeeade2dab5e3c19b5447a8417bca5b2>↩</a></li>
<li>what passes as a well here abouts does stretch the definition of
a well quite a bit, IMHO. <a href=#fnref:caeeade2dab5e3c19b5447a8417bca5b3>↩</a></li>
