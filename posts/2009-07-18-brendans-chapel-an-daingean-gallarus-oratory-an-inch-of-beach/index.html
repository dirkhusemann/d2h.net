<div><p>our final full day at tralee and the <em>ballygarry house hotel</em>. tonight
<em>we</em> are spared the noisy party guests, unfortunately other
co-pilgrims are not so lucky, they suffer from a rather rowdy crowd
leaving this night’s wedding party at about 4:00 in the morning. the
lady at reception kind of just shrugs her shoulders and replies that
it’s not their fault — which ticks me off into voicing my
disagreement with that statement…to little avail as her reply is
that “they were celebrating a <em>wedding</em>“. my response that,
surprisingly as it may sound, we were trying to <em>sleep</em> just draws the
standard answer that i could talk to the manager once he’s
in. yes. right. thank you. i almost forget to ask whether there’s a
possibility of <em>not</em> being blasted by national radio during breakfast.</p>
<p>the weather is billed as “damp all day” — which translates into
all-penetrating, fine strong drizzle rain all morning. i realise
almost too late that that kind of rain is as effective at soaking my
stuff as a strong shower…</p>
<p>first stop today: brendan’s chapel west of tralee for a moment of
quiet and reflection. brendan’s chapel is a rather modern building
with nice clean architectural lines inside — i quite like that
little church and enjoy the prayer, reading a psalm, and the moment of
quiet.</p>
<p>next stop: an daingean aka dingle for about 2 hours of sight seeing
and some shopping: i need <em>super glue</em> to fix my glasses which have
developed this nasty habit of just falling apart at the center piece
at the flick of a finger <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif alt=:-(> i do finally find a tube of that stuff at
the <em>eurospar</em> in an daingean and together with mrs d first locate the
post office (two stamps for postcards to the continent) and then the
nice little <a href=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/dinglepeninsula/D44605.html><em>an cafe liteartha</em></a> hidden away in the back
of a bookshop which itself is hidden away in a little side street of
an daingean.</p>
<p>at 12:00 we reconvene in our pilgrim’s bus and the whole band of
pilgrims is on its way to slea head again to take some “rainy day”
pictures, the real target though is the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallarus_Oratory>gallarus oratory</a>, a square
chapel dating from around 500AD build in the “classical” celtic style:
layers of stone slabs, each slightly tilted with the inner edge ending
up a bit higher than the outward facing edge, thus, preventing the
rain from getting in. our pilgrimage’s guide, mr tambour, buys the
tickets for the group and we make our way through the
café-cum-souvenir-shop-cum-ticket-counter out to the other side, then
follow a gravel path slightly up the hill through a gap in the
enclosing wall and end up a the oratory. the chapel has a doorway
facing west (i need to duck to get through) and a small-ish window
opening towards the east. wanting to get a “feel” for the place, i
wait patiently until most of the group has been inside, taken a
picture (flash, flash, flash), peeked out through the window opening,
peeked into the oratory from the outside through the window opening,
collided with me<a href=#fn:0fd4f82efae38b760f7f3671132f59621>1</a> — and manage to catch a minute or so to
myself.<a href=#fn:0fd4f82efae38b760f7f3671132f59622>2</a></p>
<p>while the rest of the group is still lingering around the oratory i
retreat to get away from the hustle & bustle for a bit — and to take
a leak. when i approach the outbuilding hosting “the facilities” my
ears pick up what sounds like a race track commentator. entering the
gents section it turns out to be a live radio feed carrying some
running commentary of a horse race being piped into the gents
toilet (the radio feed not the horse race, that is)…</p>
<p>we make our way back via an daingean and inch strand — where ms r-w
surprises us all by making a run for the beach and taking a bath in
the atlantic. to each her own.</p>
<p>dinner is a bit earlier today: we are going to the <a href=http://www.siamsatire.com/history.html><em>siamsam tíre
theater</em></a> tonight for a performance of <em>tearmann</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[&mldr;] a moving journey to the poorhouse and the Great Irish
Famine. Many of those who perished during the famine carried in
their folk memor an unknown library of music, song and dance. For
some, the last refuge was the Poorhouse. As the drama unfolds, a
pair of dance shoes becomes the embodiment of not only all that was
lost, but everything that was saved, everything that is still
cherished in Irish folk traditions. The dance shoes come to
symbolize this wealth of culture – these are magical shoes, they
have a life of their own…</em> <a href=http://www.siamsatire.com/folk_forthcoming.html#8>[siamsam tíre]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and it is a <em>very</em> impressive performance, telling exactly that story
with very few words but lots of music, (step) dance, and
expression. enjoyed it very much.</p>

<li>standing in the southwest corner of the chapel, just to the
right of the door, i’m not immediately visible… <a href=#fnref:0fd4f82efae38b760f7f3671132f59621>↩</a></li>
<li>the longer the pilgrimage takes, the more i realize that i’m not
really the group traveling kind of person — though i really do
enjoy learning about celtic spirituality as well as the stories
about ireland’s past. <a href=#fnref:0fd4f82efae38b760f7f3671132f59622>↩</a></li>
