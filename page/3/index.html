<p><p>the last day of our irish pilgrimage! after another good breakfast at
the <a href=http://www.newgrangehotel.ie/>newgrange hotel</a> we pack once more and enter our pilgrims bus
— which this morning has grown in size: morris, our excellent
driver, swapped our smaller bus yesterday evening for a bigger one as
he’s going to pick up a group of 50 at dublin airport right after
dropping us off.</p>
<p>the final “building blocks” of our pilgrimage are <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kells,_County_Meath>kells</a> and
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_of_Tara>the hill of tara</a>.</p>
<p>after a short ride we get to the little town of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kells,_County_Meath>kells</a> and
disembark. first stop: the large celtic cross that used to stand in
the middle of a busy crossroads but has now been relocated a little
outside the town center. it’s been damaged — whether that damage
originates with that unlucky encounter with that “cumbersome
schoolbus”<a href=#fn:1>1</a> or has been inflicted earlier is hard to tell — but
still interesting nevertheless.</p>
<p>from the cross we make our way up to the site of what used to be the
monastery of kells and is now a normal church — a church with four
high crosses and a replica of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_kells>book of kells</a>, though!</p>
<p>next and last pilgrimage stop: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_of_Tara>the hill of tara</a> — another site
close to the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Boyne>river boyne</a>. legend has it that tara was the seat of
the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_King_of_Ireland>high king of ireland</a>, the <em>árd rí na héireann.</em> was is known
as fact is that the hill of tara was the site of iron age hilltop
enclosure as well as the site of a neolithic passage grave. the hill
itself offers a nice view across county meath (including slane which
we visited yesterday). its other prominent features are a tea room and
two (2) souvenir shops…</p>
<p>the visit to tara concludes our pilgrimage, our next and final stop is
dublin airport with most of our co-pilgrims flying back to frankfurt
and düsseldorf in the afternoon, and with mrs d and i taking the
aircoach bus into dublin as our flight back to zurich will not leave
until tomorrow.</p>
<p>dublin airport is busy, and we just have moments to grab our luggage,
say our “goodbyes” and then we are all of a sudden by ourselves
again. after some initial trouble we manage to find the aircoach bus
stop, buy a return ticket and are soon on our way into dublin city
center. the ride takes about 40min (longer than the first time when we
used that tunnel which the aircoach buses don’t).</p>
<p>our hotel, the <em><a href=http://www.ocallaghanhotels.com/dublinmain/davenport.aspx>o’callaghan davenport hotel</a></em> is right around the
corner of the <em>marrion square north</em> aircoach bus stop. the room is OK
and we just drop our luggage off and make our way to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Dublin>trinity
college</a> to visit the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_kells>book of kells</a> exhibition.</p>
<p>we are, not surprisingly, not alone in our quest, lots of tourists
(american but also german) along with bus loads of school kids. we
manage to squeeze in and slowly make our way through the very
interesting exhibition explaining the background of the book of kells
but also how it probably was created. fascinating and well worth the
money. also, a very nice closure of our pilgrimage <img src=http://d2h.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)></p>
<p>the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Dublin#The_Library_and_culture>library’s long room</a> is nice but nothing to get really excited
about: it’s a typical old library. i had hoped for more trinity
college or even ireland related material to be on display but instead
get treated to an exhibition about napoleon bonaparte. hmph.</p>
<p>after the cultural part we are in dire need of a tea and something to
eat. following the recommendation of ms p we follow the signs in
grafton street for the <em><a href=http://goireland.about.com/od/shopping/gr/powerscourt_th.htm>powerscourt</a></em> shopping center where we have
a very nice “high tea” in the old courtyard — any thoughts on
returning for dinner are kind of squashed when around 17:15 the staff
of the café start collecting the menu cards and closing down. on
leaving we find out that 18:00 is closing time — worse than germany
in the bad old days of the <em>ladenschlußgesetz!</em> and this is the
capital or ireland!</p>
<p>our walk back to the hotel is interrupted and severely cut short by
the onset of very heavy rain. luckily we do have our umbrellas with us,
but by the time we reach our hotel we are still a bit wet.</p>
<p>being tired all of a sudden (anti-climax?) we decide to stay at the
hotel for the evening and conclude our ireland adventure with a couple
of pints of cidre and guinness in the hotel bar.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>according to
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kells,_County_Meath#Places_of_interest>wikipedia</a></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The other Celtic cross was positioned in the middle of a busy
crossroads until an unfortunate accident involving a
cumbersome school bus. It now stands in front of a former
courthouse, now a museum and coffeeshop. A roof protects the
cross from the elements. Curiously, a replica is completely
safe from the elements inside the museum.</p>

<p><p>mrs d and i slept surprisingly well this night, given the fact that
one of the main thorough-fares passes the hotel just a couple of
meters away.<a href=#fn:1>1</a> breakfast is efficient and good and the waitresses
are actually quite friendly and even know about gluten-free food for
mrs j.<a href=#fn:2>2</a></p>
<p>the weather has become rather irish: it’s raining when we set off for
a walk in the boyne valley, and it’s treating us to several showers on
the otherwise rather <em>pittoresque</em> walk. in contrast to the previous
walks we are to go by ourselves in silence and since we return to the
bus mrs d and i for once can walk as it pleases us instead of forming
the tail-end. rather quickly the whole group disperses over the length
of the path, and i rather enjoy the quietude and the breathtaking
scenery.<a href=#fn:3>3</a></p>
<p>next stop is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange>newgrange</a>, or rather the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%BA_na_B%C3%B3inne_Visitor_Centre>brú na bóinne visitor
centre</a> and the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowth>knowth</a> neolithic passage grave. mrs dr, who has
so far been doing a fantastic job translating for our non-english
speaking co-pilgrims, unfortunately is under the weather today and mr
tambour inquires whether i could be of assistance. i agree on
condition that i can make things up if i loose the plot — to which
he laughingly agrees. so, to cut a long story short: i learn quite a
bit about knowth and its history through the milleniums — our group is
a bit surprised to learn that knowth and the other mounds nearby are
in fact modelled after what science assumes to be advanced flying
objects and probably served as intergalactic beacons similar to the
lighthouses of the 19th and 20th century…</p>
<p>…ok, ok, just kidding <img src=http://d2h.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif alt=:-D> i try my best to translate everything<a href=#fn:4>4</a>
and seem to get the job done in a half-decent way.<a href=#fn:5>5</a> knowth is the
largest passage grave site in the area and even contains over one
third of all <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalithic_art>megalithic art</a> in all western europe! it’s also quite
special in that <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowth#History>several different cultures made use of it through the
milleniums.</a> fascinating stuff. as is the fact that
knowth predates the pyramids by about 500 years! i quite enjoy the
visit to knowth and the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%BA_na_B%C3%B3inne_Visitor_Centre>brú na bóinne visitor centre</a> and am quite
impressed by it.</p>
<p>after lunch at the visitor center we are on our way once more — the
weather is becoming increasingly more friendly — and, with a short
stop at the site of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Boyne>battle of the boyne</a>, visit <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monasterboice>monasterboice</a>
and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slane#The_Hill_of_Slane>the hill of slane</a>.</p>
<p>monasterboice is most famous for its <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_cross>high crosses</a> and has a couple
of rather well-preserved specimen. it’s also a “living” grave-yard:
“living” in the sense that it’s still in use today.</p>
<p>the last stop today is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slane#The_Hill_of_Slane>the hill of slane</a> where <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Patrick>st patrick</a>
supposedly lit the first easter fire. today it’s a ruined church with
a churchyard and no fire — but lots of rain all of a sudden gushing
down on us and we rather hastily beat a retreat to our waiting bus.</p>
<p>all in all a rather interesting day, knowth impressed me the most,
i’ve to say.<a href=#fn:6>6</a></p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>perhaps we got lucky that our room is behind a wall shielding us
from the traffic noise. <a href=#fnref:1>↩</a></li>
<li>having translated for mrs j a number of times when she tried to
explain to the various waiters and waitresses what gluten-free
means, i’m slowly becoming an expert on that topic — well,
almost <img src=http://d2h.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)>  <a href=#fnref:2>↩</a></li>
<li>which reminds me in places of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Beauly>river beauly</a> which <a href=http://50mm-traveller.net/2003/2003-05-21%20scotland/dscn1427-c.jpg.php>we
visited in 2003</a> <a href=#fnref:3>↩</a></li>
<li>but stumble over <em>horse shoe</em> which i translate a bit too
literally as <em>pferdeschuh</em>, which mr tambour, enthusiastic
equestrian that he is, promptly corrects to <em>hufeisen</em> — oh,
well, i never claimed to be an expert in horses… <img src=http://d2h.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)>  <a href=#fnref:4>↩</a></li>
<li>no tips, though. hmmm, guess i’ve to work on those skills a bit
then… <img src=http://d2h.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif alt=:-D>  <a href=#fnref:5>↩</a></li>
<li>a little voice in my head mumbles that i probably was so
impressed by it because for once i had to concentrate on what
was being said. hmph. <a href=#fnref:6>↩</a></li>

<p><p>after a rather good night and an equally good and relaxed
breakfast<a href=#fn:1>1</a> at <a href=http://www.hoteldoolin.ie/>hotel doolin</a> we pack once more and embark on the
long trip across ireland, going from the atlantic west coast all the
way to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navan>navan</a>. the weather is not as good as it was yesterday with
clouds covering most of the sky.</p>
<p>we don’t just go to navan directly but instead take the scenic
route. our first stop is at <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Parks_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland>burren national park</a>,</em> the smallest
of the 6 national parks in ireland and part of the larger area <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burren>the
burren</a>:</em> a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burren>karst</a> landscape exhibiting the typical karst
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone_pavement>limestone pavement</a> and also host for a number of megalithic tombs
and portal <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolmens>dolmens</a> — rather impressive. after some time to our
own we continue through the rather barren looking landscape — mr
tambour cites <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Ludlow>edmund ludlow</a>, an english parlimentarian, who is
supposed to have said during counter-guerilla operations in
1651–1652:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a country where there is not enough water to drown a man, wood
enough to hang one, nor earth enough to bury him</p>
<p><em>— [<a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A642610>h2g2, hitchhiker&rsquo;s guide
to the galaxy</a>]<a href=#fn:2>2</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>we stop at <em>burren house</em> near <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballyvaughan>ballyvaughan</a></em> for a tea, some
shopping,<a href=#fn:3>3</a> and some decompression. it’s the last chance to see the
atlantic on our pilgrimage as from now on we are going to go east
again.</p>
<p>aside from a short lunch stop in one of the little towns on the way
east we stay on our pilgrimage bus until we reach the <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonmacnoise>monastery of
clonmacnoise</a></em> in the afternoon.</p>
<p>the monastery of clonmacnoise was founded by st ciaráran in 545 AD. it
was strategically located on the main east–west land route through
ireland at that time. by the 9th century it had become <em>the</em> center of
religion, learning, craftsmanship, and trade in ireland and was in
fact a european academic focal point at the time. it’s not hard to
imagine that from places like clonmacnoise western civilization was
indeed brought back to the continent (and, thus, saved) as <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cahill>thomas
cahill</a> writes in his book <em><a href=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/cahill/irish.html>how the irish saved civilization</a>.</em></p>
<p>after an audio–visual about clonmacnoise in the visitor’s center we
go and explore the ruins of the monastery.</p>
<p>it’s in the early evening when we arrive at our hotel in navan, the
<em><a href=http://www.newgrangehotel.ie/>newgrange hotel</a></em> — which despite looking rather old is
supposedly only three years old! interesting.</p>
<p>at dinner we are joined by mr kleemann, the owner of the <a href=http://www.kleemann.ie/>travel
agency</a> that arranged the hotels and our bus. it transpires
that mr kleemann is originally from <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia>franconia</a> in northern
bavaria. he seems rather excited to see us — unfortunately that
excitement doesn’t carry over to sponsoring the drinks <img src=http://d2h.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif alt=:-(> oh, well,
it was worth a try <img src=http://d2h.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif alt=;-)></p>
<p>after dinner we invite ms r for a pint of guinness — it’s been, after
all, my birthday <img src=http://d2h.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)></p>
<p>p.s.: <em>navan</em> is a rather special city name: it’s one of the few
places having a <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_palindromic_places>palindromic name</a>!</em></p>
<hr>

<li>no problems with getting coffee, no being told off for sitting
at the wrong table <img src=http://d2h.net/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)>  <a href=#fnref:1>↩</a></li>
<li>the <em>h2g2</em> entry interestingly adds:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The words of the Cromwellian general Edmund Ludlow, describing
the area known as the Burren, are well known in Ireland. What
is less well known is that he went on to say of the people
there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…and yet their cattle are very fat; for the grass growing
in turfs of earth, of two or three foot square, that lie
between the rocks, which are of limestone, is very sweet and
nourishing.</p>
