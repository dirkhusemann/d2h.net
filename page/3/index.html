<p><p>the last day of our irish pilgrimage! after another good breakfast at
the <a href=http://www.newgrangehotel.ie/>newgrange hotel</a> we pack once more and enter our pilgrims bus
— which this morning has grown in size: morris, our excellent
driver, swapped our smaller bus yesterday evening for a bigger one as
he’s going to pick up a group of 50 at dublin airport right after
dropping us off.</p>
<p>the final “building blocks” of our pilgrimage are <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kells,_County_Meath>kells</a> and
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_of_Tara>the hill of tara</a>.</p>
<p>after a short ride we get to the little town of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kells,_County_Meath>kells</a> and
disembark. first stop: the large celtic cross that used to stand in
the middle of a busy crossroads but has now been relocated a little
outside the town center. it’s been damaged — whether that damage
originates with that unlucky encounter with that “cumbersome
schoolbus”<a href=#fn:2bbfaa21a24575eb7591685ec6e18adb1>1</a> or has been inflicted earlier is hard to tell — but
still interesting nevertheless.</p>
<p>from the cross we make our way up to the site of what used to be the
monastery of kells and is now a normal church — a church with four
high crosses and a replica of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_kells>book of kells</a>, though!</p>
<p>next and last pilgrimage stop: <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_of_Tara>the hill of tara</a> — another site
close to the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Boyne>river boyne</a>. legend has it that tara was the seat of
the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_King_of_Ireland>high king of ireland</a>, the <em>árd rí na héireann.</em> was is known
as fact is that the hill of tara was the site of iron age hilltop
enclosure as well as the site of a neolithic passage grave. the hill
itself offers a nice view across county meath (including slane which
we visited yesterday). its other prominent features are a tea room and
two (2) souvenir shops…</p>
<p>the visit to tara concludes our pilgrimage, our next and final stop is
dublin airport with most of our co-pilgrims flying back to frankfurt
and düsseldorf in the afternoon, and with mrs d and i taking the
aircoach bus into dublin as our flight back to zurich will not leave
until tomorrow.</p>
<p>dublin airport is busy, and we just have moments to grab our luggage,
say our “goodbyes” and then we are all of a sudden by ourselves
again. after some initial trouble we manage to find the aircoach bus
stop, buy a return ticket and are soon on our way into dublin city
center. the ride takes about 40min (longer than the first time when we
used that tunnel which the aircoach buses don’t).</p>
<p>our hotel, the <em><a href=http://www.ocallaghanhotels.com/dublinmain/davenport.aspx>o’callaghan davenport hotel</a></em> is right around the
corner of the <em>marrion square north</em> aircoach bus stop. the room is OK
and we just drop our luggage off and make our way to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Dublin>trinity
college</a> to visit the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_kells>book of kells</a> exhibition.</p>
<p>we are, not surprisingly, not alone in our quest, lots of tourists
(american but also german) along with bus loads of school kids. we
manage to squeeze in and slowly make our way through the very
interesting exhibition explaining the background of the book of kells
but also how it probably was created. fascinating and well worth the
money. also, a very nice closure of our pilgrimage <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)></p>
<p>the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Dublin#The_Library_and_culture>library’s long room</a> is nice but nothing to get really excited
about: it’s a typical old library. i had hoped for more trinity
college or even ireland related material to be on display but instead
get treated to an exhibition about napoleon bonaparte. hmph.</p>
<p>after the cultural part we are in dire need of a tea and something to
eat. following the recommendation of ms p we follow the signs in
grafton street for the <em><a href=http://goireland.about.com/od/shopping/gr/powerscourt_th.htm>powerscourt</a></em> shopping center where we have
a very nice “high tea” in the old courtyard — any thoughts on
returning for dinner are kind of squashed when around 17:15 the staff
of the café start collecting the menu cards and closing down. on
leaving we find out that 18:00 is closing time — worse than germany
in the bad old days of the <em>ladenschlußgesetz!</em> and this is the
capital or ireland!</p>
<p>our walk back to the hotel is interrupted and severely cut short by
the onset of very heavy rain. luckily we do have our umbrellas with us,
but by the time we reach our hotel we are still a bit wet.</p>
<p>being tired all of a sudden (anti-climax?) we decide to stay at the
hotel for the evening and conclude our ireland adventure with a couple
of pints of cidre and guinness in the hotel bar.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>according to
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kells,_County_Meath#Places_of_interest>wikipedia</a></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The other Celtic cross was positioned in the middle of a busy
crossroads until an unfortunate accident involving a
cumbersome school bus. It now stands in front of a former
courthouse, now a museum and coffeeshop. A roof protects the
cross from the elements. Curiously, a replica is completely
safe from the elements inside the museum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a picture of the cross in its original location is <a href=http://www.libraryireland.com/Atlas/Kilkenny-Celtic-Cross-Kells.php>available on

<p><p>mrs d and i slept surprisingly well this night, given the fact that
one of the main thorough-fares passes the hotel just a couple of
meters away.<a href=#fn:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a1>1</a> breakfast is efficient and good and the waitresses
are actually quite friendly and even know about gluten-free food for
mrs j.<a href=#fn:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a2>2</a></p>
<p>the weather has become rather irish: it’s raining when we set off for
a walk in the boyne valley, and it’s treating us to several showers on
the otherwise rather <em>pittoresque</em> walk. in contrast to the previous
walks we are to go by ourselves in silence and since we return to the
bus mrs d and i for once can walk as it pleases us instead of forming
the tail-end. rather quickly the whole group disperses over the length
of the path, and i rather enjoy the quietude and the breathtaking
scenery.<a href=#fn:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a3>3</a></p>
<p>next stop is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange>newgrange</a>, or rather the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%BA_na_B%C3%B3inne_Visitor_Centre>brú na bóinne visitor
centre</a> and the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowth>knowth</a> neolithic passage grave. mrs dr, who has
so far been doing a fantastic job translating for our non-english
speaking co-pilgrims, unfortunately is under the weather today and mr
tambour inquires whether i could be of assistance. i agree on
condition that i can make things up if i loose the plot — to which
he laughingly agrees. so, to cut a long story short: i learn quite a
bit about knowth and its history through the milleniums — our group is
a bit surprised to learn that knowth and the other mounds nearby are
in fact modelled after what science assumes to be advanced flying
objects and probably served as intergalactic beacons similar to the
lighthouses of the 19th and 20th century…</p>
<p>…ok, ok, just kidding <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif alt=:-D> i try my best to translate everything<a href=#fn:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a4>4</a>
and seem to get the job done in a half-decent way.<a href=#fn:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a5>5</a> knowth is the
largest passage grave site in the area and even contains over one
third of all <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalithic_art>megalithic art</a> in all western europe! it’s also quite
special in that <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowth#History>several different cultures made use of it through the
milleniums.</a> fascinating stuff. as is the fact that
knowth predates the pyramids by about 500 years! i quite enjoy the
visit to knowth and the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Br%C3%BA_na_B%C3%B3inne_Visitor_Centre>brú na bóinne visitor centre</a> and am quite
impressed by it.</p>
<p>after lunch at the visitor center we are on our way once more — the
weather is becoming increasingly more friendly — and, with a short
stop at the site of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Boyne>battle of the boyne</a>, visit <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monasterboice>monasterboice</a>
and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slane#The_Hill_of_Slane>the hill of slane</a>.</p>
<p>monasterboice is most famous for its <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_cross>high crosses</a> and has a couple
of rather well-preserved specimen. it’s also a “living” grave-yard:
“living” in the sense that it’s still in use today.</p>
<p>the last stop today is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slane#The_Hill_of_Slane>the hill of slane</a> where <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Patrick>st patrick</a>
supposedly lit the first easter fire. today it’s a ruined church with
a churchyard and no fire — but lots of rain all of a sudden gushing
down on us and we rather hastily beat a retreat to our waiting bus.</p>
<p>all in all a rather interesting day, knowth impressed me the most,
i’ve to say.<a href=#fn:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a6>6</a></p>

<li>perhaps we got lucky that our room is behind a wall shielding us
from the traffic noise. <a href=#fnref:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a1>↩</a></li>
<li>having translated for mrs j a number of times when she tried to
explain to the various waiters and waitresses what gluten-free
means, i’m slowly becoming an expert on that topic — well,
almost <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)>  <a href=#fnref:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a2>↩</a></li>
<li>which reminds me in places of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Beauly>river beauly</a> which <a href=http://50mm-traveller.net/2003/2003-05-21%20scotland/dscn1427-c.jpg.php>we
visited in 2003</a> <a href=#fnref:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a3>↩</a></li>
<li>but stumble over <em>horse shoe</em> which i translate a bit too
literally as <em>pferdeschuh</em>, which mr tambour, enthusiastic
equestrian that he is, promptly corrects to <em>hufeisen</em> — oh,
well, i never claimed to be an expert in horses… <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)>  <a href=#fnref:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a4>↩</a></li>
<li>no tips, though. hmmm, guess i’ve to work on those skills a bit
then… <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif alt=:-D>  <a href=#fnref:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a5>↩</a></li>
<li>a little voice in my head mumbles that i probably was so
impressed by it because for once i had to concentrate on what
was being said. hmph. <a href=#fnref:02c7f750f546f3d7a6cf958a452b6f6a6>↩</a></li>

<p><p>after a rather good night and an equally good and relaxed
breakfast<a href=#fn:d409b385109aba321cf1062fc3cfa0841>1</a> at <a href=http://www.hoteldoolin.ie/>hotel doolin</a> we pack once more and embark on the
long trip across ireland, going from the atlantic west coast all the
way to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navan>navan</a>. the weather is not as good as it was yesterday with
clouds covering most of the sky.</p>
<p>we don’t just go to navan directly but instead take the scenic
route. our first stop is at <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Parks_in_the_Republic_of_Ireland>burren national park</a>,</em> the smallest
of the 6 national parks in ireland and part of the larger area <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burren>the
burren</a>:</em> a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burren>karst</a> landscape exhibiting the typical karst
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone_pavement>limestone pavement</a> and also host for a number of megalithic tombs
and portal <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolmens>dolmens</a> — rather impressive. after some time to our
own we continue through the rather barren looking landscape — mr
tambour cites <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Ludlow>edmund ludlow</a>, an english parlimentarian, who is
supposed to have said during counter-guerilla operations in
1651–1652:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a country where there is not enough water to drown a man, wood
enough to hang one, nor earth enough to bury him</p>
<p><em>— [<a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A642610>h2g2, hitchhiker&rsquo;s guide
to the galaxy</a>]<a href=#fn:d409b385109aba321cf1062fc3cfa0842>2</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>we stop at <em>burren house</em> near <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballyvaughan>ballyvaughan</a></em> for a tea, some
shopping,<a href=#fn:d409b385109aba321cf1062fc3cfa0843>3</a> and some decompression. it’s the last chance to see the
atlantic on our pilgrimage as from now on we are going to go east
again.</p>
<p>aside from a short lunch stop in one of the little towns on the way
east we stay on our pilgrimage bus until we reach the <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonmacnoise>monastery of
clonmacnoise</a></em> in the afternoon.</p>
<p>the monastery of clonmacnoise was founded by st ciaráran in 545 AD. it
was strategically located on the main east–west land route through
ireland at that time. by the 9th century it had become <em>the</em> center of
religion, learning, craftsmanship, and trade in ireland and was in
fact a european academic focal point at the time. it’s not hard to
imagine that from places like clonmacnoise western civilization was
indeed brought back to the continent (and, thus, saved) as <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cahill>thomas
cahill</a> writes in his book <em><a href=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/cahill/irish.html>how the irish saved civilization</a>.</em></p>
<p>after an audio–visual about clonmacnoise in the visitor’s center we
go and explore the ruins of the monastery.</p>
<p>it’s in the early evening when we arrive at our hotel in navan, the
<em><a href=http://www.newgrangehotel.ie/>newgrange hotel</a></em> — which despite looking rather old is
supposedly only three years old! interesting.</p>
<p>at dinner we are joined by mr kleemann, the owner of the <a href=http://www.kleemann.ie/>travel
agency</a> that arranged the hotels and our bus. it transpires
that mr kleemann is originally from <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franconia>franconia</a> in northern
bavaria. he seems rather excited to see us — unfortunately that
excitement doesn’t carry over to sponsoring the drinks <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif alt=:-(> oh, well,
it was worth a try <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif alt=;-)></p>
<p>after dinner we invite ms r for a pint of guinness — it’s been, after
all, my birthday <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)></p>
<p>p.s.: <em>navan</em> is a rather special city name: it’s one of the few
places having a <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_palindromic_places>palindromic name</a>!</em></p>
<hr>

<li>no problems with getting coffee, no being told off for sitting

<li>the <em>h2g2</em> entry interestingly adds:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>The words of the Cromwellian general Edmund Ludlow, describing
the area known as the Burren, are well known in Ireland. What
is less well known is that he went on to say of the people
there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…and yet their cattle are very fat; for the grass growing
in turfs of earth, of two or three foot square, that lie
between the rocks, which are of limestone, is very sweet and
nourishing.</p>

<p><p>it’s sunday. our last night at the <em>ballygarry house hotel</em> was quiet
for a change, which is nice. also, as long as our group is having
breakfast, we are spared the rather annoying radio blast.<a href=#fn:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de291>1</a></p>
<p>after breakfast mrs d and i pack our stuff and join the rest of the
pilgrims in our pilgrims bus. the first stop today is in <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listowel>listowel</a>
— apparently the literary capital of ireland. our stop is short: mr
tambour, our pilgrimage guide, as always, is extremely well prepared
and we learn quite a bit about listowel and its literary sons and
daughters — but also take a look at listowel’s racetrack <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)> during
the bus ride from tralee to listowel a co-pilgrim mentioned that
apparently writers with a residence in ireland would live tax-free:
might that explain the relatively high percentage of writers in
relation to the total population? oh, one other thing that’s worth
mentioning about listowel: the pedestrian crossing at the newsagents
on the main square has an absolutely cool sounding free-to-walk
alarm…</p>
<p>it’s a short stop only as we need to catch the 10:00 <a href=http://www.shannonferries.com/>ferry</a> from
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarbert,_County_Kerry>tarbert</a> across the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Shannon>river shannon</a> and after 20min or so we are
on our way again.</p>
<p>the ferry across the river shannon is a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry#Double-ended>double-ended, open top type
of ferry</a> with integral ramps which just drop down to the concrete
ferry slips. we do make it to tarbert with about 10min to spare and
take the opportunity to have a look across the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_Estuary>shannon
estuary</a>. the crossing itself is fairly eventless (ignoring that
strong shower just before we reach the other side of the river
shannon) and we are soon on our way through county clare to
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahinch>lahinch</a> with a short stop at <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilkee>kilkee</a> to have a look at <em>kilkee
cliffs</em>.</p>
<p><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahinch>lahinch</a> means lunch-time! we get dropped off at the sea promenade
and mrs d and i do find a nice pub-cum-restaurant, the <a href=http://www.shamrockinn.ie/>shamrock
inn</a> where we have a rather nice little lunch. it’s a popular place
with the locals it seems and service is very friendly and prompt. the
food is excellent (as is my pint of guinness <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)> )</p>
<p>at about 14:00 we reconvene at our pilgrims’s bus and are off
again. next stop: <em>brigid’s well</em> — yep, there’s another one<img src=#fn:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de296 alt=2>
this one, in contrast to the other wells we’ve seen so far, is located
directly next to the main road and sits to the side of a pub and below
a cemetery. interesting combination that. the highlight of our visit
is another story by our master story teller, ms k, about the celtic
goddess brigid.</p>
<p>of the three places, cemetery, well, and pub, we unfortunately only
get to see the well and are soon on our way again to the <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliffs_of_moher>cliffs of
moher</a></em>!</p>
<p>now, the cliffs of moher: a name that seems to have jumped right of
the pages of <em><a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit>the hobbit</a></em>, conjuring up images of wild, remote,
difficult to reach cliffs…</p>
<p>well…</p>
<p>…not exactly. if there are any links to hobbit land, then it must be
the sticky spider’s web of the black forest of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirkwood>mirkwood</a> which
trapped bilbo’s dwarf companions — the cliffs of moher are one
gigantic tourist trap. the scenery is nice, what with dramatic cliffs
and views west.<a href=#fn:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de292>3</a> that is true — just don’t look at the king-sized
cafeteria, the exhibition center<a href=#fn:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de295>4</a>, and a large shopping area
selling all the kitsch ireland can throw at you — <em>plus</em> several
smaller shops (more kitsch and even more kitsch). mrs d and i speed up
to the cliff tops on either side, take a peek at the tower on the
north cliff, decide to not pay the entrance fee for the tower, and
fight our way back down to the cafeteria — the wind is blowing
strongly today — and have a cup of tea, take a look at the kitsch on
sale, and settle down to enjoy the sun.</p>
<p>from the cliffs of moher tourist trap our pilgrimage continues towards
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doolin>doolin</a>. instead of going there directly by bus, we get to do a
little walk today and approach it from <em>lough north</em>, a nice little walk
taking us through the west irish coastal scenery.</p>
<p>our hotel in doolin, <em><a href=http://www.hoteldoolin.ie/>hotel doolin</a></em>, is a newly build hotel in a
modern, contemporary style, quite nice. dinner is is the adjoining
pub–restaurant, a bit relaxed and not as speedy as the busy
<em>ballygarry house hotel</em>, but i quite like it. the food is excellent!</p>
<p>after dinner we split up into little groups and swarm out into the
scattered village of doolin to visit <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doolin#Pubs>the pubs</a> — tonight is
“irish pub night”! mrs d and i opt for the “original one”, <em>gus
o’connors</em>, founded in 1832.</p>
<p>when we arrive at about 21:45, the live music is already playing (a
bit slowly still, but picking up steam [literally] as the night
progresses). we settle in with a pint of guinness and cidre and enjoy
the music and also the chat with our co-pilgrims.</p>
<p>quite a day <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)></p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>though, as soon as we are finished and leave, they <em>do</em> turn the
radio up to full blast again. <a href=#fnref:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de291>↩</a></li>
<li>here’s my theory on celtic saints: first, to be eligible for
celtic sainthood you need to have at least <em>one</em> well or spring
named after you; second, the more wells and springs you can collect
the more important, saint-wise, you are. <a href=#fnref:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de296>↩</a></li>
<li>rumor has it, that on a fine day<a href=#fn:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de293>5</a> you <em>can</em> see the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue_of_liberty>statue of liberty</a><img src=#fn:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de294 alt=6> <a href=#fnref:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de292>↩</a></li>
<li>hosting an exhibition about the atlantic ocean when we were
there. <a href=#fnref:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de295>↩</a></li>
<li>for certain definitions of <em>fine</em>, almost all of them probably
involving larger quantities of guinness… <a href=#fnref:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de293>↩</a></li>
<li>and, yes, i just might be making this up as i go… <a href=#fnref:9d8ddf9da9f503e83c6f7826b1f8de294>↩</a></li>

<p><p>our final full day at tralee and the <em>ballygarry house hotel</em>. tonight
<em>we</em> are spared the noisy party guests, unfortunately other
co-pilgrims are not so lucky, they suffer from a rather rowdy crowd
leaving this night’s wedding party at about 4:00 in the morning. the
lady at reception kind of just shrugs her shoulders and replies that
it’s not their fault — which ticks me off into voicing my
disagreement with that statement…to little avail as her reply is
that “they were celebrating a <em>wedding</em>“. my response that,
surprisingly as it may sound, we were trying to <em>sleep</em> just draws the
standard answer that i could talk to the manager once he’s
in. yes. right. thank you. i almost forget to ask whether there’s a
possibility of <em>not</em> being blasted by national radio during breakfast.</p>
<p>the weather is billed as “damp all day” — which translates into
all-penetrating, fine strong drizzle rain all morning. i realise
almost too late that that kind of rain is as effective at soaking my
stuff as a strong shower…</p>
<p>first stop today: brendan’s chapel west of tralee for a moment of
quiet and reflection. brendan’s chapel is a rather modern building
with nice clean architectural lines inside — i quite like that
little church and enjoy the prayer, reading a psalm, and the moment of
quiet.</p>
<p>next stop: an daingean aka dingle for about 2 hours of sight seeing
and some shopping: i need <em>super glue</em> to fix my glasses which have
developed this nasty habit of just falling apart at the center piece
at the flick of a finger <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif alt=:-(> i do finally find a tube of that stuff at
the <em>eurospar</em> in an daingean and together with mrs d first locate the
post office (two stamps for postcards to the continent) and then the
nice little <a href=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/dinglepeninsula/D44605.html><em>an cafe liteartha</em></a> hidden away in the back
of a bookshop which itself is hidden away in a little side street of
an daingean.</p>
<p>at 12:00 we reconvene in our pilgrim’s bus and the whole band of
pilgrims is on its way to slea head again to take some “rainy day”
pictures, the real target though is the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallarus_Oratory>gallarus oratory</a>, a square
chapel dating from around 500AD build in the “classical” celtic style:
layers of stone slabs, each slightly tilted with the inner edge ending
up a bit higher than the outward facing edge, thus, preventing the
rain from getting in. our pilgrimage’s guide, mr tambour, buys the
tickets for the group and we make our way through the
café-cum-souvenir-shop-cum-ticket-counter out to the other side, then
follow a gravel path slightly up the hill through a gap in the
enclosing wall and end up a the oratory. the chapel has a doorway
facing west (i need to duck to get through) and a small-ish window
opening towards the east. wanting to get a “feel” for the place, i
wait patiently until most of the group has been inside, taken a
picture (flash, flash, flash), peeked out through the window opening,
peeked into the oratory from the outside through the window opening,
collided with me<a href=#fn:0fd4f82efae38b760f7f3671132f59621>1</a> — and manage to catch a minute or so to
myself.<a href=#fn:0fd4f82efae38b760f7f3671132f59622>2</a></p>
<p>while the rest of the group is still lingering around the oratory i
retreat to get away from the hustle & bustle for a bit — and to take
a leak. when i approach the outbuilding hosting “the facilities” my
ears pick up what sounds like a race track commentator. entering the
gents section it turns out to be a live radio feed carrying some
running commentary of a horse race being piped into the gents
toilet (the radio feed not the horse race, that is)…</p>
<p>we make our way back via an daingean and inch strand — where ms r-w
surprises us all by making a run for the beach and taking a bath in
the atlantic. to each her own.</p>
<p>dinner is a bit earlier today: we are going to the <a href=http://www.siamsatire.com/history.html><em>siamsam tíre
theater</em></a> tonight for a performance of <em>tearmann</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[&mldr;] a moving journey to the poorhouse and the Great Irish
Famine. Many of those who perished during the famine carried in
their folk memor an unknown library of music, song and dance. For
some, the last refuge was the Poorhouse. As the drama unfolds, a
pair of dance shoes becomes the embodiment of not only all that was
lost, but everything that was saved, everything that is still
cherished in Irish folk traditions. The dance shoes come to
symbolize this wealth of culture – these are magical shoes, they
have a life of their own…</em> <a href=http://www.siamsatire.com/folk_forthcoming.html#8>[siamsam tíre]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and it is a <em>very</em> impressive performance, telling exactly that story
with very few words but lots of music, (step) dance, and
expression. enjoyed it very much.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>standing in the southwest corner of the chapel, just to the
right of the door, i’m not immediately visible… <a href=#fnref:0fd4f82efae38b760f7f3671132f59621>↩</a></li>
<li>the longer the pilgrimage takes, the more i realize that i’m not
really the group traveling kind of person — though i really do
enjoy learning about celtic spirituality as well as the stories
about ireland’s past. <a href=#fnref:0fd4f82efae38b760f7f3671132f59622>↩</a></li>

<p><p>breakfast today (we are still at the <a href=http://www.ballygarryhouse.com/><em>ballygarry house
hotel</em></a>) works out a bit better than
yesterday: more coffee and tea available, no being told off for
sitting at the wrong table. <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)></p>
<p>today’s program: by bus to the starting point of the pass up to the
gap of dunloe, walk from there over the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_of_dunloe>gap of
dunloe</a> and down to
<em>brandon’s cottage</em> for a cup of tea, followed by a boat trip across
the lakes of killarney to the town of killarney.</p>
<p>we are off at 9:00 on the dot and get to our starting point by
9:50. the pass road is restricted to horse-drawn coaches, walkers and
business and commercial access. horse-drawn coaches are about €30 per
coach each and apparently in high-demand at times as there are quite a
few of them along with the required horses around. as we start on our
walk we witness two coaches (gigs, really) taking off with the drivers
flogging the horses quite severely several times. guess they lost any
potential customers in our group.</p>
<p>the walk up to the gap of dunloe is what turner and company would call
<em>pittoresque</em> — wild landscape rising up to each side, a succession
of little lakes, a winding road up to the pass. again, mrs d and i
bring up the rear of the pilgrim’s train and are joined today by mrs
c. the higher we get the stronger the wind blows up towards the pass
— fantastic! we are occasionally overtaken by a horse-drawn gig,
sometimes by cars<a href=#fn:3c517313a6f08edac7e42542275638491>1</a> and once or twice by folks on bikes, some more,
some less skilled in the art of cycling. the weather puts on a
dramatic show, but stays dry until we have passed the highest point,
the gap of dunloe. the pass down into the valley on the eastern side
reminds me of the eastern snowdown pass topology: the same
north–south valley formation almost.</p>
<p>after a lunch break just beyond the pass summit we are on our way down
to <em>brandon’s cottage</em>, a self-serve “restaurant” operated on behalf
of the national park. the scenery is still breathtakingly beautiful.</p>
<p>after a coke (me) and a cup of tea (mrs d) along with two slices of
apple pie with cream we enjoy the view until our boats across the
lakes of killarney depart.</p>
<p>the boats turn out to be, err, boats, wooden ones with a little
outboard motor. each boat seating up to 12 people. after a bit of
engine trouble we depart from <em>brandon’s cottage</em> and are on our way
across the three lakes and two rivers.</p>
<p><em>tranquil</em> is the word that describes the first part of our ride —
<em>tranquil</em> is not the word that i’d choose for the second part. where
the first part was just gliding along on the calm surface of the upper
lake and the connecting river leaving it, once we reach the
three-river-meeting point we first need to pass across a bit of
white-water (necessitating a re-balancing of the boat by having us all
shift forward). from the three-river-meeting point onwards we enjoy a
bit of smooth “sailing” which turns out to lull us into a false sense
of security: once we leave the third lake and enter the last one, the
largest of the three, we literally hit rough sea. the wind is blowing
and has been blowing long enough today to really cause quite a bit of
wave action. after a re-reshuffle (all move towards the back of the
boat) we tackle it stern-on. splash, splash, splash summarises the
next 15min as we crash through one wave crest after the other. fun <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif alt=:-D></p>
<p>unfortunately, about half-way down the lake we need to cross the lake
to get to ross castle — meaning we are now moving in parallel to the
waves, also meaning our little boat is rotating back and forth along
its longitudinal axis, fun…</p>
<p>we do make it to shore, and get together, with a cup of tea, to have one more
story told by our resident master story teller: this time it’s about a
blind bagpipe player, and the castle in the lake of killarney. again,
i’m fascinated by her story telling talent and enjoy the story
tremendously.</p>
<p>then it’s back to the hotel again — one photo-op stop to have one
final view across the lakes of killarney — to take a shower, change
into fresh clothes, and dinner at 18:30 today as we are going to visit
the <a href=http://www.siamsatire.com/folk.html>siamsa tíre theater</a> here in tralee! looking forward to that one!</p>

<p><p>around 2:00 in the morning: a group of hotel guests from that
anniversary party very kindly let us in into their conversations they
are having in the parking lot outside the hotel entrance — for about
half an hour we get to share each and every attempt at
jokularity… much appreciated.</p>
<p>at breakfast mrs d and i commit the <em>faux pas</em> of seating ourselves at
one of the free tables as the large group table seems to be fully
occupied. we quickly get told off by an apparently unmotivated,
round-ish waitress who informs us that <em>that</em> table is needed for
“other guests”<a href=#fn:caeeade2dab5e3c19b5447a8417bca5b1>1</a> — not quite the “irish hospitality”. coffee and
tea are just that, but also seemingly rationed: we only manage to get
2 cups of each each.</p>
<p>today’s part of the pilgrimage takes us to brandon’s well<a href=#fn:caeeade2dab5e3c19b5447a8417bca5b2>2</a> which is
a bit outside tralee. the actual well itself, the water hole in the
earth, is a bit on the quiet side<a href=#fn:caeeade2dab5e3c19b5447a8417bca5b3>3</a> but otherwise a nice little area
enclosed by a dense hedge. we read a psalm, listen to some thoughts of
mr tambour on <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%205:1-15;&version=31;">john 5:1–15 (the story of the healing at lake
bethesda)</a>, and conclude with a prayer and song.</p>
<p>the next part takes us through <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingle>an daingean</a> (aka dingle) —
replenishing our proviant at the local <em>supervalu</em> [sic] (i use the
opportunity to frequent the pharmacy next to the the aforementioned
<em>supervalu</em> to acquire some midge repellent and antihistamin: those
little buggers have really taken a fancy of me, i must have about 30
midge bites on my arms, neck and head) — along the dingle
peninsula. about 2.5 hours walk from <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingle_Peninsula>slea head</a> we are released
from our pilgrimage transporter and get a chance to walk to slea
head. the weather is at its best: in contrast to the forecast of the
irish met office we have pure, unadulterated sunshine! over the ring
of kerry we can see <em>cumulus congestus</em> clouds piling up, some looking
like they are severly tempted to turn into <em>cumulus nimbus</em> clouds —
we only have rather innocent looking straits of <em>cumulus humilis</em>
clouds coming our way. perfect.</p>
<p>while on tuesday, on kevin’s way, mrs d and i sped ahead, quickly
leaving the bulk of the group behind, we decide today to stay at the
end and “bring up the rear”, so to speak. mr tambour seems strangely
relieved by that — i can’t figure out whether he’s relieved to have
experienced walkers at the rear of the group or whether he is relieved
that we are not chasing ahead again. in any case we stay back and have
a couple of quite interesting chats on the way.</p>
<p>the scenery is fantastic: in front of us the wide open sea, framed on
both sides by mountain ranges and outlying little isles and rocks,
dark clouds on the other side of the bay piling up in-lands, the sun
casting interesting cloud shadows across the almost smooth surface of
the sea. the path to slea head winds past dry-stone walls (lots of
sheep), first up then down again. about 2 hours into the walk we break
for a snack-lunch and enjoy the quiet and the views!</p>
<p>at slea head we have about an hour to ourselves which most of us spend
at the café having a crumble and a pot of tea.</p>
<p>the way back to tralee is interrupted by a story telling session at the
beach: one of our co-pilgrims is a practised story teller and really
spins an enticing piece of yarn about a bloke called mccormack, an
enchanted branch, and how he lost his wife, daughter, and son — and
regained them later. i really enjoy that bit.</p>

<li>guests who never show up during the remainder of the breakfast
time, strangely enough… <a href=#fnref:caeeade2dab5e3c19b5447a8417bca5b1>↩</a></li>
<li>i guess to qualify as a saint in ireland you must have, at
least, one well named after you. <a href=#fnref:caeeade2dab5e3c19b5447a8417bca5b2>↩</a></li>
<li>what passes as a well here abouts does stretch the definition of
a well quite a bit, IMHO. <a href=#fnref:caeeade2dab5e3c19b5447a8417bca5b3>↩</a></li>

<p><p>no “madame–baby” wake-up call this morning (i guess mr charming
realized that madame was already taking a shower when he called) but a bit of re-packing before breakfast as today we are relocating to
tralee in county kerry. having learnt from yesterday’s breakfast i
appear on the scene 15min early and order coffee (for me) and tea (for mrs d) along with my cooked breakfast — ms rough charme tries to force me to use the german breakfast menu but i stubbornly insists on
using the original. i while away the time until coffee and tea arrive
by reading the <em>irish independent</em>. at around 8:00 coffee, tea, <em>and</em>
toast arrive, 5min later mrs d and we are all set to start
breakfast…</p>
<p>…well, almost. when mrs d pours her cup of tea we are both a bit
surprised at how strong it turns out to be. that surprise is nothing,
though, compared to the surprise of mrs d when taking the first sip:
she pulls a face, looks quite a bit startled, then takes a peek at the
contents of her tea pot — and laughs: apparently the breakfast crew
is under quite a bit of stress and mistakenly filled her tea pot with
coffee and threw in a tea bag. our breakfast waitress is as surprised
as we and quickly remedies the situation.</p>
<p>at 9:00 we are all packed and ready to go. first stop today is
<em>brigid’s well</em> in <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kildare>kildare</a>. the weather has improved (it’s no
longer raining) and we take this first spell of dry weather not only
to learn about brigid but also to learn about each other:
introductions! brigid’s well is in the middle of fields just outside
kildare and consists of an enclosed well at one end being “fed”<a href=#fn:ed20c699d8ebe8e4d8ad1712a1d235151>1</a> by
the original well at the other end of the garden. the front part is
connected to the back part by a sequence of five stones (mini
<em>menhirs</em>) each standing for a certain characteristic of st
brigid. one sentence strikes a chord with me: “live in the here and
now and all will be well”</p>
<p>kildare cathedral is next on the program and impresses me with its
rather clean design and construction. not pompous at all.</p>
<p>a visit with sister mary of the <a href=http://www.solasbhride.ie/solas-bhride.htm><em>centre for celtic
spirituality</em></a> concludes the morning:
sister mary explains about the briget order, its history and, again,
about celtic spirituality. rather interesting. and also located in an
interesting loation: right in the middle of a residential area in
kildare — which is, if you think about it, rather in-line with the
credo of celtic spirituality: god around us, within us, above us,
below us, in front of us, and behind us.</p>
<p>after a rather spiritually engaging morning we leave kildare and are
on our way to the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_of_cashel><em>rock of
cashel</em></a> in
tipperary. the trip from kildare to tipperary is not as long as it
used to be (”it’s a long road to tipperary…”) due a new highway
having just been opened. the weather has improved dramatically: the
sun’s out and about, the rain of yesterday a faint memory.</p>
<p>at rock of cashel we have a late little lunch in <em>granny’s kitchen</em>
then visit the castle.</p>
<p>it’s almost 19:00 when we reach our hotel for the next four nights,
the <a href=http://www.ballygarryhouse.com/><em>ballygarry hotel</em> in tralee</a>
— decidedly an improvement over the last one: very nice rooms, and
dinner service actually delivers what’s written on the outside.</p>
<p>plus, it’s got working WLAN service <img src=http://d2h.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif alt=:-)></p>

<ol>
<li>“fed” in quotes as we later notice that the water level of the
original well at the end of the property is well below the pipe
leading to the enclosed well at the front of the garden — a bit
puzzling that. <a href=#fnref:ed20c699d8ebe8e4d8ad1712a1d235151>↩</a></li>

<p><p><em>ring, ring</em> — mrs d picks up the phone, it’s the 7:15 wake-up call
and, as expected, nobody answers back. time to get up. <em>ring, ring</em>
— mrs d picks up the phone yet again, this time round it’s the bloke
from reception asking whether “madame is ok?”, madame affirms and
receives a rather charming “ok, baby”. this somewhat incongruous start
into our first day as pilgrims in ireland kind of forms the fabric of
the day: it stays incongruous, constantly changing between dry and
rather wet.</p>
<p>breakfast at the <a href=http://www.standhousehotel.com/><em>stand house hotel</em></a>
is, compared to dinner, a bit of a let down: the orange and cranberry
juice suffers from a rather high concentration of water and introduces
the gnawing suspicion that the breakfast staff have not yet grasped
the concept that orange juice concentrate should not be used to dilute
water but rather the other way round. the cooked breakfast is on the
ok side of cooked breakfasts (we’ve had worse, but we’ve also had
better), the waitress a charm that would work quite well inside a wood
workshop, taking rough edges off…</p>
<p>while the sun is still shining we leave by bus for the first part of
our pilgrimage: the <em>eurospar</em> at kilcullen (food always played an
important role on pilgrimages through the ages).</p>
<p>next, through narrow, winding roads we aim for hollywood — and miss on the first
attempt. after some tapping of local knowledge<a href=#fn:30982eb5ed749f80caa0316f3071a1641>1</a> we make it with
take 2 and, a few miles outside of hollywood, start our walking
part: we are following part of <a href="http://www.heritagecouncil.ie/recreation/heritage-council-initiatives/the-pilgrim-paths/st-kevins-way/?L=0">kevin’s way</a> in the direction of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendalough>glendalough</a>.</p>
<p>the weather has turned sour on us, and alternatively treats us
to dry and wet spells while we are still on the hard road part of the
walk. once we reach the footpath along the river, however, it’s found
its stride and just pours it out all the way to pass road for wicklow
pass. d’oh.</p>
<p>the landscape is rather nice though and it’s kind of fun walking
through the drenched scenery regardless of the rain. after about 2.5
hours we reach the pass road to wicklow pass and are rescued by our
bus. next stop: glendalough.</p>
<p>at glendalough are the rather interesting remains of the old
monasteric city. it was originally founded by <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_of_Glendalough>kevin</a> who intended
to lead a solitary life as a hermit — that plan didn’t work out too
well and kevin had to scupper it quite quickly as other folks like
that idea of leading a solitary life in that spot of ireland,
and…joined him.<a href=#fn:30982eb5ed749f80caa0316f3071a1642>2</a> a thriving community evolved around the
monasteric buildings and quickly turned from a mere dwelling into a
town.</p>
<p>what is interesting about glendalough is the way they lived a life
that did not differentiate between worldly matters and spiritual
matters but instead practised a holistic spirituality, the celtic
spirituality: god is among us, around us, above us and below us and
with us in everything we do and live — in contrast to the
continental european theology which is mostly a kind of dualistic
theology (god above in heaven, we down below on earth). there are
parallels to dietrich bonhoeffer’s view that god is not a god of the
boundaries or gaps<a href=#fn:30982eb5ed749f80caa0316f3071a1643>3</a> but instead a god in our midst (and only
makes sense as such) — a view that i’ve made my own ever since i
encountered it and, thus, am pleasantly surprised to encounter it
here again and also to learn that there is a long tradition supporting
that view.</p>
<p>after we had made our way through the (heavily visited) ruins of the
monasteric city we spent about an hour with dominican sister genevieve
who explained to us the history behind and nature of celtic
spirituality — a very fascinating hour!</p>
<p>dinner was a bit less organized than yesterday (the notion of drinks
along with food was a novelty to the two waitresses this evening, but
they quickly realized that it might indeed be a good idea), the quality of the food was good.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>luckily, those two old men <em>did</em> know their way around, unlike
me sometime in the early 1990s in the north of jeresey when i
unintentionally mis-directed a bus full of tourists looking for
jersey airport (of which they were as far away as they could
possibly get on that island). <a href=#fnref:30982eb5ed749f80caa0316f3071a1641>↩</a></li>
<li>some folks really don’t get even simple ideas… <a href=#fnref:30982eb5ed749f80caa0316f3071a1642>↩</a></li>
<li>that is, god as our explanation for all those things we do not
understand — and as a consequence, a god that we keep pushing
further and further away from us the more we manage to explain
ourselves. <a href=#fnref:30982eb5ed749f80caa0316f3071a1643>↩</a></li>
