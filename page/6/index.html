<p><p>what’s happened to us? another night at the movies! a colleague from
germany had recommended <a href=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382330/combined><em>wie im himmel</em> (english title: <em>as it is in
heaven</em>)</a>…at first it seemed a bit brutal, to
say the least, and i was wondering about my colleague’s taste — but
once the real action starts (daniel returning back to the village
where he was born) the movie starts to really unfold and takes you on
an emotional roller-coaster-ride — and has some very pointed
dialogues about living one’s life instead of being lived and instead
of being locked in by
we’ve-always-done-it-this-way-no-need-to-change-it-now-or-ever.</p>
<p>we liked it very much.</p>

<p><p>we’ve been in northern germany back at <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoykenkamp>my parents
place</a> over the weekend, taking the 9:01 train from
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen>erlangen</a> to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg>nürnberg,</a> then the 9:39
ICE to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannover>hannover</a>, and finally the 12:45 from hannover
to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delmenhorst>delmenhorst</a> — where we are picked up by my
father and given a lift to my parents place in
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoykenkamp>hoykenkamp.</a></p>
<p><img src=https://d2h.net/blog/imgs/dirk-20.gif alt> the reason for our trip north: the 20th
anniversary of my “abitur” (i.e., high school graduation or GCE-A
levels) class. the whole event had been meticulously planned by a
couple of former class mates and we even have <a href=http://www.willms85.de/>our own web
site</a>!</p>
<p>the evening was quite interesting…the “event” itself took place in
the <em>kämmerei</em>, the old wool-carding place of the <a href=http://www.delmenhorst.de/nordwolle/museen/ title="rated SGR (some german required)">old <em>nordwolle</em>
spinning works,</a> long since turned into a pub. some of us
have changed quite a bit (which, i think, is a good think), some
of us have not changed a single iota (which in some cases was a
bit…how shall i put it…shocking?). in any case it was good and fun
reconnecting 20 years later.</p>

<p><p><a href=http://www.spiegel.de/>today’s spiegel online reports</a> that the probably soon to be german
finance minister <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_Steinbr%C3%BCck>peer steinbrück</a> plans to <a href=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,380051,00.html>sell off germany’s
autobahns</a> to close gaping canyons in the german
budget.</p>
<p>interesting. how much is a piece of autobahn then? according to the
article the lowest estimate is a whooping (or not so whooping)
€127’000’000’000 for all of the roughly 12’000km of german
autobahn. which, more or less, comes down to <strong>€10’584/m.</strong></p>
<p>so…if i were to buy 10m of autobahn (does it come with or without
signalisation BTW?) that would set me back about €106’000. what i
would do with 10m of autobahn? that, as the cautious engineer is wont
to say, depends…</p>
<p>here are the options:</p>
<ul>
<li>if it close to where i live, i’d <strong>turn it into a walled garden.</strong></li>
<li>if it’s not close to where i live, i’d <strong>build a lovely toll
station</strong> (just for those 10m, of course) complete with very nice
and easy to use money drop-off points, soothing colours and an
viewing platform complete with café — all very user friendly.</li>
</ul>
<p>what do you mean that this is what the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highwayman>highwaymen</a> did? no, no,
no. i wouldn’t be threatening anyone. besides those would-be-users of
my would-be-toll-station would get a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service>service</a> for they money: i’d
be optimising their fuel consumption (i leave it as an <em>exercise to
the reader</em> to figure that one out :-)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>p.s.: it seems the SPD’s coalition partner, the CDU, has got wind
of my plans: they are against selling the autobahn now…oh, well.</em></p>

<p><p>have been listening to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_chant>gregorian music</a> all day
during work: kind of soothing & calming in its simplicity…bought
them all at <a href=http://audiolunchbox.com/>audiolunchbox</a> (another music service “that get’s it”).</p>

<p><p><a href=http://www.diegrossestille.de/english/ title="image © Philip Gröning Filmproduktion"><img src=https://d2h.net/blog/imgs/die_grosse_stille_detail.jpg alt></a>
went out tonight to watch a movie — which in itself is rare, as we
rather watch “new” movies on DVD at home than go and sit with 50, 100,
or even 200 other people in a more or less (un)comfortable seat, with
a guaranteed tall person to come in at the last minute and take the
seat(s) in front of you.</p>
<p>what was unusual about this movie was that it was shown inside the
university church, the <a href=http://www.erlangen-evangelisch.de/Neustadt/>neustädter kirche</a>, that
it was shown using <a href=http://www.delicatessen.org/hintergrundIII.html>digital projection (not a beamer!, we were
told)</a>, and the movie itself: <a href=http://www.diegrossestille.de/english/><em>die grosse stille</em> (or
<em>into great silence</em>)</a>.</p>
<p>the movie is about the life of the monks of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthusian>carthusian
order</a> and in particular about life in the mother
abbey, the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Chartreuse>monastery of the grand chartreuse.</a> it
starts almost in silence, and we watch a carthusian monks as he
prays. the only sound we can hear is the crackling of the wood-burning
stove. eventually the screen switches to a closeup of snow-flakes
swirling outside the monastery before slowly immersing itself (and us
with it) into the carthusian life.</p>
<p><a href=http://www.diegrossestille.de/english/video/high.html>the trailer</a> is very misleading: essentially they have
just taken “action scenes” from <em>into great silence</em>. the movie itself
is very much different. there’s no commentary. there’s no musical
soundtrack, the only sounds we get to hear are the sounds of everyday
life in the monastery: monks chanting, the sounds of hair being razed
off, steps in a hallway,… a “scene” can take minutes, without much
happening.</p>
<p>this all sounds rather boring…it’s not (and i’m not the person
enjoying watching water come to the boil, not really). you have to be
able to stand silence. this movie will force you to reflect on
yourself and what you believe in, to reflect on what you think is
important and why. <em>into great silence</em> very subtly takes you by your
hand and while your still wondering what this movie is about, you are
already captured; you are already wondering what those monks are
thinking about, what they are contemplating about; you are already
taking part in a two and a half hour meditation…</p>
<p>watch it — if you are up to it.</p>

<p><p>rainy sunday…take the s-bahn from mannenbach to kreuzlingen and
thence to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstanz>konstanz</a>. continue on to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrichshafen>friedrichshafen</a> by the <a href=http://www.der-katamaran.de/de/>newly
installed katamaran service.</a> the trip is quite nice, quite
a number of passengers on the kat, but not too many :-)</p>
<p>we arrive around 12:00 in friedrichshafen, almost right at the
entrance of the <a href=http://www.zeppelin-museum.de/firstpage.en.htm><em>zeppelin museum</em></a>, our destination
for today. inside we are at first quite surprised to see long queues
but then remember that is fall vacation time, it’s raining, so what do
you do when you’ve got a bunch of kids to entertain? right.</p>
<p>the museum is (as always) rather interesting. i’m still fascinated by
the zeppelin concept — i guess if there were zeppelin operated
flights, i’d rather take one of those than any of those
crammed-and-we-don’t-give-a-fig-about-you-as-a-passenger
airliners! alas, not an option (<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeppelin#Recent_developments>currently</a>)…</p>

<p><p>up at 7:15, getting everything cleaned up and in ship shape…9:01, we
take the <a href="http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/zuginfo.exe/dn/355800/229718/596852/179826/80/ld=212.26&seqnr=4&ident=o4.01969249.1130072274&currentReferrer=tp&">RE train from erlangen to nürnberg,</a> then the <a href="http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/zuginfo.exe/dn/8688/126083/456946/225577/80/ld=212.26&seqnr=4&ident=o4.01969249.1130072274&currentReferrer=tp&">IC

mannenbach-saalenstein</a>…we arrive on time in
<a href=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannenbach>mannenbach-saalenstein</a></p>
<p>our hotel, the <a href=http://www.seehotel.ch/><em>seehotel schiff</em></a>, is literally just
around the corner from the railway station and only a 3min walk. it’s
located directly at the shore of the <a href=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodensee>bodensee</a> (“lake
constance”) — and from our room at the top of the hotel we have a
very nice view across to <a href=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichenau>reichenau</a> and across the
lower bodensee to <a href=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radolfzell>radolfzell.</a></p>
<p>the weather, having been quite nice so far this week in erlangen, has
turned autumnal: fog, an occasional light drizzle. as we are just in
time for tea we have the same.</p>
<p>dinner is in the hotel’s restaurant. we are seated in “second row” not
at the windows (probably because we are showing up “late”, around
19:30). we take the <em>captain’s dinner,</em> an assortment of local and
not-so-local fish, quite nice.</p>
