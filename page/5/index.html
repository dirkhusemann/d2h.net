<p><p>just watched BBC1’s <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/>insideout</a>, especially a feature about the
“development” of london’s portobello road. “development” in quotes
because it’s really about driving out old, established small shops and
businesses to increase the yield through rents that are 100% higher
and can only be afforded by the big chain stores (just noticed that my
hands wanted to write “chain saws”…fitting, though, as these chain
stores just mercilessly cut through established societal fabrics,
destroying local culture and colour wherever they appear). the term
the presenter <a href=http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/insideldn/insideout/sumit_bose.shtml>sumi bose</a> used was <em>clonetowns</em> — very
appropriate!</p>

<p><p>no, i didn’t mean to write “track suit” :-) the <a href=http://suitsat.org/>astronauts on the ISS
will be releasing a used astronaut’s spacesuit filled with a radio and
sensors into orbit.</a> according to <a href=http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/26jan_suitsat.htm>NASA’s suitsat
page</a> explains how the russian cosmonauts came up with
the idea of stuffing “three batteries, a radio transmitter, and
internal sensors to measure temperature and battery power” into used
(and, one assumes, retired) spacesuits. using a police scanner (hmm,
now, who’d have one of <em>those?</em>) or a ham radio one can tune in:
145.990 MHz FM :-)</p>
<p>now, if we could just release all <a href=http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/S/suit.html>suits</a> into space…</p>

<p><p>just read an article in the <a href=http://www.heise.de/tr/artikel/68680>german edition of february’s <em>technology
review</em></a> about the work of <a href=http://www.uft.uni-bremen.de/oekologie/hartmutkoehler.htm>harmut koehler</a>
on the <a href=http://www.revitec.de/>revitec(tm) project.</a> the revitec project tries to
stop and reverse desertification by using jute bags (recycled coffee
bean bags, bremen is one of the major german coffee importing and
processing ports) filled with sand, compost and other organic
material. the jute bags are then used as “breeding ground” for weeds,
grass, and even tree. the jute bags decompose over time (after two
years they apparently have completely disintegrated) and the plants
then tend to spread further and further — and stop desertification!
a nice project.</p>
<p><img src=https://d2h.net/blog/imgs/dirk-20.gif alt> reminds me a bit of my attempt to create a
pair of grass trousers back in 1985 as a kind of running gag for <a href=http://www.willms85.de/treffen.php>our
high school graduation week</a> — i took a pair of old jeans,
a can of spray-on glue, applied the stuff to the pair of jeans, then
sprinkled grass seeds all over it and kept the whole appliance wet for
a couple of weeks. well, the only thing running was my nose: i had
applied the spray-on glue in a closed room and my nose had not taken
that assault kindly, causing me to sit through my verbal exams with a
case of a badly running nose…the grass pants didn’t really work out
as planned. (it would have looked cool though ;-)</p>
<p>lessons learned back then:</p>
<ul>
<li>gardening was not my forte</li>
<li>reading the manual is sometimes a good thing to do</li>

<p><p>this morning had us a bit worked up: we had planned and then this
morning led through <a href=https://d2h.net/blog/belief/2006-01-22-erlangen.pdf>today’s worship service</a> at <a href=http://www.efg-erlangen.de/>our baptist
church here in erlangen</a>. all a bit exciting and we certainly
had a bout of stage fever. everything worked out fine and even the
<a href=https://d2h.net/blog/belief/friede-gottes.pdf>sermon</a> was well received (sigh of relief :-)</p>
<p><a href=https://d2h.net/blog/photos/2006-a-pix-a-day/slides/dsc02132.html><img src=https://d2h.net/blog/photos/2006-a-pix-a-day/thumbs/dsc02132.jpg alt></a>over lunch
we were invited by friends, which we enjoyed very much. the rest of
the afternoon is spent working on the missing <a href=https://d2h.net/blog/photos/2006-a-pix-a-day/slides/dsc02117.html>pictures of last
thursday,</a> <a href=https://d2h.net/blog/photos/2006-a-pix-a-day/slides/dsc02119.html>friday,</a> <a href=https://d2h.net/blog/photos/2006-a-pix-a-day/slides/dsc02122.html>saturday,</a> and <a href=https://d2h.net/blog/photos/2006-a-pix-a-day/slides/dsc02132.html>sunday…</a>
(you might notice that saturday’s picture technically is not really
saturday’s picture: the date & time recorded in it’s EXIF data is
already past midnight and would thus indicate that it’s been taken on
sunday already: not so, the clock on my digital camera is still
running on summer time [and i can’t be bothered to switch it, not with
another summer time rushing towards us]).</p>

<p><p>it’s sunday…yesterday we attended a <a href=http://emknews.umc-europe.org/2005/dezember/29-01.php>full day workshop on “aufatmen
und frei sein”</a> (roughly translated as “breath again and
be free”) which was organized by the united methodist church of
switzerland and took place in zurich. it was rather refreshing and
provided lots of encouragement not only to take a positive, christian
view of the world but also to try and make a difference in other
people’s lives. the workshop was done by robert seitz (contributing
excellent texts, giving much food for thought) and <a href=http://www.fankhauser.de/christof/>christof
fankhauser</a> (accentuating and amplifying seitz’s texts through
his musical meditations and songs). excellent stuff.</p>
<p>today, we are off to take a winter walk. originally i wanted to take a
walk on <a href=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigi>top of rigi</a> — to which my beloved wife objects on
the grounds that it takes <em>too</em> long to get there…hmm…the argument
that there’s a very pleasant boat ride from lucerne to vitznau
included somehow does not find a lot of purchase — instead an
alternative is proposed: <a href=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugerberg>zugerberg.</a> at first i’m quite
sceptical. “zugerberg” sounds like a lot like <a href=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uetliberg>“üetliberg”, the
favourite local mountain of all of zurich</a> (with good
weather up on üetliberg and bad weather down in zurich, that is quite
often in winter, you almost have to queue to take a walk)…but: it
only takes 1 hour 10min to get there by public transport. as my wife
(as always :-) has a point about the travel time required to get on
top of rigi, we finally agree on zugerberg.</p>
<p>so, after a nice sunday morning breakfast we take the train at 10:55
to sihlbrugg, change into the train from zurich to zug, take a local
bus up to the ground station of the <a href=http://www.zbb.ch/ title="utterly broken website...">zugerberg funicular railway</a>
and then the funicular railway up the mountain. while it’s all grey in
grey down in the plain, once we pass the 900m mark we break through to
the sun! up at the mountain station we have a fantastic view across
the alps, with pilatus to our right, followed by rigi and a bunch of
other mountains (sorry, pilatus & rigi are about the only ones i can
identify — unlike mr r who knows the silhouette of <em>every</em> swiss
mountain from any direction at any time of day).</p>
<p>we take the large walk combining winter walks #2, #3, and #4 into one
long walk. quite a number of people are up here, but it’s not crowded
yet. part of the high plateau up zugerberg consists of moor land: and
the vegetation looks rather like the moor land of northern germany
transplanted to the alps! cool! :-)</p>
<p>all in all a very nice day — thanks to dorothee!</p>

try. above is my first. taken on the way from <a href=http://www.efg-erlangen.de/>church</a> to the

<p><p>while discussing travel arrangements for next years vacation in
england (london & the isle of wight) we wondered whether it would be
possible to get from the isle of wight (<a href=http://www.shalfiow.demon.co.uk/piers/piers.htm>ryde</a>, to be precise) to
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen>erlangen</a> in one day…<strong>by train!</strong> to make it more interesting,
we didn’t want to get up in the middle of the night, so a decent
departure time, like 9 o’clock was desired…</p>
<p>so, off we go and ask the <a href="http://reiseauskunft.bahn.de/bin/query.exe/en?ld=212.19&newrequest=yes&">european train timetable
oracle</a>…which to our immense surprise returns the following
schedule:</p>

<p>which is not really <em>that</em> bad. were we to take a rental car, we’d
have to drive all the way from southampton to heathrow, drop of the
car, get to the terminal at least one hour early, endure the customary
delays (pilot got locked in in the WC, co-pilot lost his key to the
cockpit, & whatever else they’ll come up with…more inventive
regarding excuses than we were back in high school those airline
people, that’s for sure), the fly over (with nasty turbulences over
the channel, over france, just after the start…”oh, look, there’s a
thunderstorm that just popped up all of a sudden, sorry about that
really, but we hope you enjoy the flight with us today”), then we’d
have to change planes in frankfurt or munich or zurich (alternatively
we could fly from luton but then we’d have to cross london and that
would easily take us 12 hours alone ;-), then wait some more (fog in
beijing causing delays in frankfurt or munich or zurich), then fly to
nuremberg airport, get a taxi and be home probably around the same
time — just completely knackered and unnerved.</p>
<p>so, take the train or take the plane? hmm….tough decision…<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lol>LOL</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>p.s.: yes, <a href=http://www.topgear.com/content/features/category/clarkson/1.html>clarkson</a> would do that trip in a 1001 breakhorsepower
lamburghini-mazda-aston-martin in a little under 5 hours (and could
have done better if it hadn’t been for that tractor near the french

online</a> about the west german radio station WDR
recovering their 1956 web site from their archives!</p>
<p>excellent archaeological work! they managed to completely restore
their vintage 1956 web site. i particularly like the <a href=http://www.wdr.de/themen/kultur/rundfunk/wdr/textrundfunk/fernseh/index.html>tv
programme section</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>on sunday, 1 january 1956 they had only three (3) broadcasts, while</li>
<li>on monday, 2 january 1956 they had an almost full programme with a
rocking 9 broadcasts and a “switch-over at 21:25” (whatever that
was). wow! those were the days…</li>
</ul>
<p>you also might want to <a href=http://www.wdr.de/themen/kultur/rundfunk/wdr/textrundfunk/blog/index.html>check out their blog…</a></p>

<p><p>quite sad <a href=http://www.guardian.co.uk/frontpage/story/0,,1666899,00.html>to read about the execution of tookie william</a>
last night. the common view by commentators seems to be that
california’s governor, <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger>arnold schwarzenegger</a>,
did not grant clemency because of not wanting to his republican
clientel to appear soft on crime — and in particular wanted to boost
his image after having lost several referendums and elections in the
last months.</p>
<p>mr william has been in prison for such a long time that in other,
civilized, countries he’d have served a life sentence already. from
what is reported of mr william, he seems to have done a 180°
turn-around from his criminal past, has been instrumental in resolving
gang wars in as far away places as new york, has been writing books
for kids and teenagers in which he delivers a very strong message
against joining gangs.</p>
<p>mr schwarzenegger nevertheless decided not to pardon mr william —
mainly on the grounds that tookie william never regretted the crimes
he’d been sentenced to death for. now, the reason why mr william
didn’t apologized for those crimes is that he’s maintained since
before his trial that he did not commit those crimes.</p>
<p>so, to get this straight: there is a man sentenced to death, sitting
in death row for the most part of his life, has done a very convincing
and effective 180° turn-around from his criminal past (has to all
intents, facts, and purposes repented) and has always maintained his
innocence about the crimes he’s been accused of — denying clemency
on the grounds of him having never apologized for the crimes he is
alleged to have committed is a rather arrogant and presumptuous
position. arrogant and presumptuous because it assumes that that
judgement was a correct and just judgement and it fails to acknowledge
the history of wrongly assigned sentences and, even worse, death
sentences.</p>
<p>in my opinion mr schwarzenegger literally walks over dead bodies to
further his own “career” — and certainly is not man enough to grant
a pardon to mr william. if you ask me: a rather wimpy terminator…</p>
