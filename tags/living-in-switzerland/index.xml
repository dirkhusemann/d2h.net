this year’s play is kino etzel — which @jmdhh and i went to see tonight.</description></item><item><title>world’s first twitter wallfahrt!</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-29-worlds-first-twitter-wallfahrt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2010 20:27:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-29-worlds-first-twitter-wallfahrt/</guid><description>9:10 — ms d and i arrive at einsiedeln railway station, all kitted out in our walking gear, ready to go. walking past the train we spot our fellow pilgrims. yep, pilgrims: we are on our way to the starting point of the world’s first twitter pilgrimage, the #twallfahrt1 from pfäffikon to einsiedeln. in the train we meet @decolores1, @konzertharfe, @sempreincorsaa also ready to go on the #twallfahrt. just before the train is about to depart at 9:13 we are joined at the last second by @abtmartin — good thing, too, as he is supposed to lead us on our pilgrimage i’m looking forward to the first twitter pilgrimage which is at the same time my first pilgrimage on foot (last year’s pilgrimage was by bus, which somehow gives it a different twist, i think).</description></item><item><title>swiss conservatives: annex regions surrounding switzerland!</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-06-12-swiss-conservatives-annex-regions-surrounding-switzerland/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jun 2010 09:40:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-06-12-swiss-conservatives-annex-regions-surrounding-switzerland/</guid><description>yesterday’s tagesanzeiger report on a parliamentary motion of the swiss conservatives right-wing, nationalist party SVP to prepare the annexation of all regions surrounding switzerland — no, today’s not the first of april.
interesting.
as the tagesanzeiger rightly observes that would add about 10 million germans to the population (plus almost another million german speaking citizens of alsace, vorarlberg, &amp;amp; bolzano) — just a couple of months ago the SVP, never afraid of playing the lowest available instruments of fear, uncertainty, and doubt, staged a campaign claiming that the ETH was being overtaken by german professors (skillfully representing sliced statistics to “prove” their point).</description></item><item><title>switzerland — behind the scenes…</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-12-29-switzerland-behind-the-scenes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2009 21:07:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-12-29-switzerland-behind-the-scenes/</guid><description>ever wondered what happens behind the scenes of touristic switzerland? ever wanted to know how the swiss manage to present one of the most beautiful places on earth in such impeccable order? ever interested in the music that drives the swiss?1

at biberbrugg i meet up with mrs d who has just been dropped of by fredi and is tired but happy from a fantastic day out. together we hop on to the train to einsiedeln and walk/hobble home picture links:</description></item><item><title>middle of lake lucerne, 14:00</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-06-01-middle-of-lake-lucerne-1400/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2009 17:09:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-06-01-middle-of-lake-lucerne-1400/</guid><description>the post bus ride from ibergeregg pass down to schwyz was, well, exciting if not adventurous. in contrast to the more gentle norther approach from oberiberg, the southern approach really takes you into the alps with breathtaking views across lake lucerne, up to the huser stock and hengst mountains — all the way constantly going back and forth, left and right, most of the time with no space for two cars, let alone a car and post bus, to pass each other.</description></item><item><title>ibergeregg pass, 10:20</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-06-01-ibergeregg-pass-1020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2009 08:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-06-01-ibergeregg-pass-1020/</guid><description>first stop on my tour through the swiss alps by public transport: ibergeregg pass.
the post bus from oberiberg wound its way up the pass road navigating lots of curves and bends each time sounding its characteristic swiss post bus horn: dah-dee-doh-dah!

instead of moapping around at home, however, i’ve planned a little mountain and lake tour myself — using only public transport i intend to go from einsiedeln via oberiberg to ibergeregg pass, have a coffee break there and enjoy the panorama, then on to the capital of our canton, schwyz.</description></item><item><title>groundforce afternoon</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-05-30-groundforce-afternoon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 May 2009 20:11:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-05-30-groundforce-afternoon/</guid><description>originally our plans for the pentecost weekend had been to do a two day walk in the napf area, a rather nice walking area between lucerne and berne. originally…
well, two weeks ago we set out to find the “across einsiedeln” geocache — which was supposed to be a rather simple one in easy terrain. as the weather was quite warm i didn’t put on my mountain boots but instead went in sandals — had i but known… we did find the GPS location of the “across einsiedeln” geocache, but didn’t find the cache itself.</description></item></channel></rss>
