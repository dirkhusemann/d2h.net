my grandfather was a sea-faring man, and, what is more, he helped create an island… an island that is still visible today.
he was employed by the North German Lloyd aka Norddeutscher Lloyd as an officer, his last ship was the steamship goslar. shortly before the outbreak of world war II the goslar was on its way back to germany and had just passed the panama canal when adolf the terrible declared war on poland.</description></item></channel></rss>
