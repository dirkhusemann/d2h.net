Here you will stuff that I find interesting, useful, or noteworthy for some reason or other &amp;mdash; in short, stuff the cat dragged in, or the sea delivered to our doorsteps.
This blog is built using
hugo, emacs, a derivative of the smigle hugo theme, the computer modern typewriter font, and the special elite typewriter font, and is hosted via github.

for a couple of sub-albums i wanted to make use of the background music feature offered by the turtle skin.</description></item></channel></rss>
