the weather has become rather irish: it’s raining when we set off for a walk in the boyne valley, and it’s treating us to several showers on the otherwise rather pittoresque walk.</description></item><item><title>the burren, limestone pavement, clonmacnoise, &amp; an almost secret birthday</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-20-limestone-pavement-an-almost-secret-birthday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2009 20:21:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-20-limestone-pavement-an-almost-secret-birthday/</guid><description>after a rather good night and an equally good and relaxed breakfast1 at hotel doolin we pack once more and embark on the long trip across ireland, going from the atlantic west coast all the way to navan. the weather is not as good as it was yesterday with clouds covering most of the sky.
we don’t just go to navan directly but instead take the scenic route. our first stop is at burren national park, the smallest of the 6 national parks in ireland and part of the larger area the burren: a karst landscape exhibiting the typical karst limestone pavement and also host for a number of megalithic tombs and portal dolmens — rather impressive.</description></item></channel></rss>
