for some reasons i narrowed in on BBC4 and encountered old friends such as “the now show” (which i regularly listen to via their podcast) or less known shows such as the intriguingly named “life: an idiot’s guide” (need to check that one out).</description></item><item><title>a time trip to the 1950s</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2012-01-22-a-time-trip-to-the-1950s/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2012 14:58:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2012-01-22-a-time-trip-to-the-1950s/</guid><description>even though the place we live at here in switzerland has a rather rural character — there are several livestock markets throughout the year down at the station square, very few regions regularly vote more conservative than ours — einsiedeln has a surprising cultural live. one of the driving forces is the chaernehus, which several times a year hosts cabaret, an exhibition, and stages a play.
this year’s play is kino etzel — which @jmdhh and i went to see tonight.</description></item><item><title>smells &amp; memory</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2012-01-16-smells-memory/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2012 23:58:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2012-01-16-smells-memory/</guid><description>the other day @jmdhh and i were out shopping. while i was waiting at one of the shops i was “hit” by a smell of coffee — and immediately taken back to the apartment of my grandmother in the late 60s, early 70s. she lived in bremerhaven, one of the german sea ports, and had a penchant for coffee.
her apartment always smelled of coffee in a certain way — the smell of coffee emanating from that shop at which i was waiting for @jmdhh must have hit my olfactory memory at just the right spot and triggered that flashback to my childhood.</description></item><item><title>some more pseudo HDR experiments</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-31-some-more-pseudo-hdr-experiments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2010 07:46:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-31-some-more-pseudo-hdr-experiments/</guid><description>during sunday’s #twallfahrt i managed to take a couple of 5-step bracketed pictures, two of which i think produced some interesting results. the first one is the view from etzel pass towards einsiedeln:
at first i thought that it looks a bit weird, then i realized (and on my way home looked at the clouds with “different eyes”) that it does look like that.
the second one is a classical, an in-door shot in the church of the monastery of einsiedeln1:</description></item><item><title>world’s first twitter wallfahrt!</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-29-worlds-first-twitter-wallfahrt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2010 20:27:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-29-worlds-first-twitter-wallfahrt/</guid><description>9:10 — ms d and i arrive at einsiedeln railway station, all kitted out in our walking gear, ready to go. walking past the train we spot our fellow pilgrims. yep, pilgrims: we are on our way to the starting point of the world’s first twitter pilgrimage, the #twallfahrt1 from pfäffikon to einsiedeln. in the train we meet @decolores1, @konzertharfe, @sempreincorsaa also ready to go on the #twallfahrt. just before the train is about to depart at 9:13 we are joined at the last second by @abtmartin — good thing, too, as he is supposed to lead us on our pilgrimage i’m looking forward to the first twitter pilgrimage which is at the same time my first pilgrimage on foot (last year’s pilgrimage was by bus, which somehow gives it a different twist, i think).</description></item><item><title>how my grandfather created an island…</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-05-16-how-my-grandfather-created-an-island/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2010 18:24:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-05-16-how-my-grandfather-created-an-island/</guid><description>my grandfather was a sea-faring man.1
my grandfather was a sea-faring man, and, what is more, he helped create an island… an island that is still visible today.
he was employed by the North German Lloyd aka Norddeutscher Lloyd as an officer, his last ship was the steamship goslar. shortly before the outbreak of world war II the goslar was on its way back to germany and had just passed the panama canal when adolf the terrible declared war on poland.</description></item><item><title>d2h.net now mobile friendly</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-10-24-d2h-net-now-mobile-friendly/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2009 20:43:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-10-24-d2h-net-now-mobile-friendly/</guid><description>thanks to the excellent wordpress mobile pack wordpress plugin i’m pleased to announce that d2h.net is now mobile enabled: if you visit it on your android or iDon’t, err, iPhone you’ll get a mobile browser-friendly version of our web site. also, http://m.d2h.net/ will take you to the mobile version directly as well.

after breakfast mrs d and i pack our stuff and join the rest of the pilgrims in our pilgrims bus. the first stop today is in listowel — apparently the literary capital of ireland. our stop is short: mr tambour, our pilgrimage guide, as always, is extremely well prepared and we learn quite a bit about listowel and its literary sons and daughters — but also take a look at listowel’s racetrack during the bus ride from tralee to listowel a co-pilgrim mentioned that apparently writers with a residence in ireland would live tax-free: might that explain the relatively high percentage of writers in relation to the total population?</description></item><item><title>brendan’s chapel, an daingean, gallarus oratory, an inch of beach</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-18-brendans-chapel-an-daingean-gallarus-oratory-an-inch-of-beach/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2009 20:10:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-18-brendans-chapel-an-daingean-gallarus-oratory-an-inch-of-beach/</guid><description>our final full day at tralee and the ballygarry house hotel. tonight we are spared the noisy party guests, unfortunately other co-pilgrims are not so lucky, they suffer from a rather rowdy crowd leaving this night’s wedding party at about 4:00 in the morning. the lady at reception kind of just shrugs her shoulders and replies that it’s not their fault — which ticks me off into voicing my disagreement with that statement…to little avail as her reply is that “they were celebrating a wedding“.</description></item><item><title>more vincent stuff…</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-11-more-vincent-stuff/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2009 19:40:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-11-more-vincent-stuff/</guid><description>looking through drscofield’s twitter messages of the past couple of days i noticed @pixelq’s twitter about “watching the world” and i had to head over to youtube to watch this 3D internet masterpiece once more. IMHO it’s one of the most beautiful pieces of art (and it’s a pity it wasn’t on display in basel recently) — have a look yourself:
almost makes you cry…

at biberbrugg i meet up with mrs d who has just been dropped of by fredi and is tired but happy from a fantastic day out. together we hop on to the train to einsiedeln and walk/hobble home picture links:</description></item><item><title>middle of lake lucerne, 14:00</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-06-01-middle-of-lake-lucerne-1400/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2009 17:09:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-06-01-middle-of-lake-lucerne-1400/</guid><description>the post bus ride from ibergeregg pass down to schwyz was, well, exciting if not adventurous. in contrast to the more gentle norther approach from oberiberg, the southern approach really takes you into the alps with breathtaking views across lake lucerne, up to the huser stock and hengst mountains — all the way constantly going back and forth, left and right, most of the time with no space for two cars, let alone a car and post bus, to pass each other.</description></item><item><title>ibergeregg pass, 10:20</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-06-01-ibergeregg-pass-1020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2009 08:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-06-01-ibergeregg-pass-1020/</guid><description>first stop on my tour through the swiss alps by public transport: ibergeregg pass.

instead of moapping around at home, however, i’ve planned a little mountain and lake tour myself — using only public transport i intend to go from einsiedeln via oberiberg to ibergeregg pass, have a coffee break there and enjoy the panorama, then on to the capital of our canton, schwyz.</description></item></channel></rss>
