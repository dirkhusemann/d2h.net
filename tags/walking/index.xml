the riverside is a small hotel run by david and brenda milne a bit outside ambleside, right next to the river rothay on the quiet under loughrigg lane leading from ambleside to rydal.</description></item><item><title>a walk through pittoresque boyne valley, time travel, monasterboice, &amp; the hill of slane</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-21-a-walk-through-pittoresque-boyne-valley-time-travel-monasterboice-slaine/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2009 20:40:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-21-a-walk-through-pittoresque-boyne-valley-time-travel-monasterboice-slaine/</guid><description>mrs d and i slept surprisingly well this night, given the fact that one of the main thorough-fares passes the hotel just a couple of meters away.1 breakfast is efficient and good and the waitresses are actually quite friendly and even know about gluten-free food for mrs j.2
the weather has become rather irish: it’s raining when we set off for a walk in the boyne valley, and it’s treating us to several showers on the otherwise rather pittoresque walk.</description></item><item><title>gap of dunloe &amp; the lakes of killarney</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-17-gap-of-dunloe-the-lakes-of-killarney/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2009 18:26:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-17-gap-of-dunloe-the-lakes-of-killarney/</guid><description>breakfast today (we are still at the ballygarry house hotel) works out a bit better than yesterday: more coffee and tea available, no being told off for sitting at the wrong table. today’s program: by bus to the starting point of the pass up to the gap of dunloe, walk from there over the gap of dunloe and down to brandon’s cottage for a cup of tea, followed by a boat trip across the lakes of killarney to the town of killarney.</description></item></channel></rss>
