People donâ€™t want to run their own servers, and never will.
Running your own server is fun and very instructional &amp;mdash; for geeks like usâ€¦
â€¦for a timeâ€¦
â€¦after about 20 years or so you&amp;rsquo;ve seen it all, done it all, tried it all, met all the script kiddies in your logs, evaded them by moving your SSH server port out of harm&amp;rsquo;s way (not that you were using password-based ssh accounts to begin with, it was just so annoying to see them try the same thing over and over again, no creativity really, come onâ€¦), dito for the attack attempts on your nginx server (again, easily foiled, by using a handful of fail2ban rules).</description></item><item><title>Aboutâ€¦</title><link>https://d2h.net/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 19:07:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/about/</guid><description>Welcome to my blog, d2h.net. Here you will stuff that I find interesting, useful, or noteworthy for some reason or other &amp;mdash; in short, stuff the cat dragged in, or the sea delivered to our doorsteps.
This blog is built using
hugo, emacs, a derivative of the smigle hugo theme, the computer modern typewriter font, and the special elite typewriter font, and is hosted via github.

In a nutshell Evan has set up a continuous integration chain for his hugo based website. The workflow is as follows:
create the new hugo post on whatever device you want commit the post and push to github github triggers the continuous integration service travis travis regenerates the static web site travis deploys the static web site Where Evan is using github, travis, and S3 I wanted to go the self-hosted route.</description></item><item><title>Full Circle</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2019-05-19-switching-to-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2019 16:53:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2019-05-19-switching-to-hugo/</guid><description>OK, I&amp;rsquo;m back to where I started, blog-wise: statically generated content. The first incarnation of d2h.net was using an emacs generated blog, this time round I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up with using hugo.
The workflow is a bit different now from back then: content is contained in a self-hosted gitea instance, which is feeding into a self-hosted drone instance, all docker-ized.
The hugo theme is not quite there yet, expect changes ðŸ˜€</description></item></channel></rss>
