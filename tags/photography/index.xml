the second one is a classical, an in-door shot in the church of the monastery of einsiedeln1:</description></item><item><title>mucking around with pseudo HDRs</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-28-mucking-around-with-pseudo-hdrs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2010 19:53:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-28-mucking-around-with-pseudo-hdrs/</guid><description>it’s taken a long time, but i finally managed to upload the pictures of our lake district vacation (back in may, yes…) to our photo website, the 50mm-traveller. for most of the pictures i used the exposure bracketing mode of my D700 (i.e., one picture taken at normal exposure, one a full stop below and the third a full stop above) together with the high-speed setting (5 pictures per second).</description></item></channel></rss>
