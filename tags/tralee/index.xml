at breakfast mrs d and i commit the faux pas of seating ourselves at one of the free tables as the large group table seems to be fully occupied.</description></item><item><title>a new breakfast beverage, brigid’s well, rock of cashel</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-15-a-new-breakfast-beverage-brigids-well-rock-of-cashel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2009 20:38:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-15-a-new-breakfast-beverage-brigids-well-rock-of-cashel/</guid><description>no “madame–baby” wake-up call this morning (i guess mr charming realized that madame was already taking a shower when he called) but a bit of re-packing before breakfast as today we are relocating to tralee in county kerry. having learnt from yesterday’s breakfast i appear on the scene 15min early and order coffee (for me) and tea (for mrs d) along with my cooked breakfast — ms rough charme tries to force me to use the german breakfast menu but i stubbornly insists on using the original.</description></item></channel></rss>
