at first i thought that it looks a bit weird, then i realized (and on my way home looked at the clouds with “different eyes”) that it does look like that.
the second one is a classical, an in-door shot in the church of the monastery of einsiedeln1:</description></item><item><title>world’s first twitter wallfahrt!</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-29-worlds-first-twitter-wallfahrt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2010 20:27:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-29-worlds-first-twitter-wallfahrt/</guid><description>9:10 — ms d and i arrive at einsiedeln railway station, all kitted out in our walking gear, ready to go. walking past the train we spot our fellow pilgrims. yep, pilgrims: we are on our way to the starting point of the world’s first twitter pilgrimage, the #twallfahrt1 from pfäffikon to einsiedeln. in the train we meet @decolores1, @konzertharfe, @sempreincorsaa also ready to go on the #twallfahrt. just before the train is about to depart at 9:13 we are joined at the last second by @abtmartin — good thing, too, as he is supposed to lead us on our pilgrimage i’m looking forward to the first twitter pilgrimage which is at the same time my first pilgrimage on foot (last year’s pilgrimage was by bus, which somehow gives it a different twist, i think).</description></item><item><title>kells, tara, airport, trinity college, chilling out</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-22-kells-tara-airport-trinity-college-chilling-out/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2009 20:58:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-22-kells-tara-airport-trinity-college-chilling-out/</guid><description>the last day of our irish pilgrimage! after another good breakfast at the newgrange hotel we pack once more and enter our pilgrims bus — which this morning has grown in size: morris, our excellent driver, swapped our smaller bus yesterday evening for a bigger one as he’s going to pick up a group of 50 at dublin airport right after dropping us off.
the final “building blocks” of our pilgrimage are kells and the hill of tara.</description></item><item><title>a walk through pittoresque boyne valley, time travel, monasterboice, &amp; the hill of slane</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-21-a-walk-through-pittoresque-boyne-valley-time-travel-monasterboice-slaine/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2009 20:40:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-21-a-walk-through-pittoresque-boyne-valley-time-travel-monasterboice-slaine/</guid><description>mrs d and i slept surprisingly well this night, given the fact that one of the main thorough-fares passes the hotel just a couple of meters away.1 breakfast is efficient and good and the waitresses are actually quite friendly and even know about gluten-free food for mrs j.2
the weather has become rather irish: it’s raining when we set off for a walk in the boyne valley, and it’s treating us to several showers on the otherwise rather pittoresque walk.</description></item><item><title>the burren, limestone pavement, clonmacnoise, &amp; an almost secret birthday</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-20-limestone-pavement-an-almost-secret-birthday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2009 20:21:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-20-limestone-pavement-an-almost-secret-birthday/</guid><description>after a rather good night and an equally good and relaxed breakfast1 at hotel doolin we pack once more and embark on the long trip across ireland, going from the atlantic west coast all the way to navan. the weather is not as good as it was yesterday with clouds covering most of the sky.
we don’t just go to navan directly but instead take the scenic route. our first stop is at burren national park, the smallest of the 6 national parks in ireland and part of the larger area the burren: a karst landscape exhibiting the typical karst limestone pavement and also host for a number of megalithic tombs and portal dolmens — rather impressive.</description></item><item><title>listowel, shannon river ferry, lahinch, sunday lunch, cliffs of moher, live music at doolin</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-19-listowel-shannon-river-ferry-lahinch-sunday-lunch-cliffs-of-moher-live-music-at-doolinrimage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2009 21:25:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-19-listowel-shannon-river-ferry-lahinch-sunday-lunch-cliffs-of-moher-live-music-at-doolinrimage/</guid><description>it’s sunday. our last night at the ballygarry house hotel was quiet for a change, which is nice. also, as long as our group is having breakfast, we are spared the rather annoying radio blast.1
after breakfast mrs d and i pack our stuff and join the rest of the pilgrims in our pilgrims bus. the first stop today is in listowel — apparently the literary capital of ireland. our stop is short: mr tambour, our pilgrimage guide, as always, is extremely well prepared and we learn quite a bit about listowel and its literary sons and daughters — but also take a look at listowel’s racetrack during the bus ride from tralee to listowel a co-pilgrim mentioned that apparently writers with a residence in ireland would live tax-free: might that explain the relatively high percentage of writers in relation to the total population?</description></item><item><title>brendan’s chapel, an daingean, gallarus oratory, an inch of beach</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-18-brendans-chapel-an-daingean-gallarus-oratory-an-inch-of-beach/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2009 20:10:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-18-brendans-chapel-an-daingean-gallarus-oratory-an-inch-of-beach/</guid><description>our final full day at tralee and the ballygarry house hotel. tonight we are spared the noisy party guests, unfortunately other co-pilgrims are not so lucky, they suffer from a rather rowdy crowd leaving this night’s wedding party at about 4:00 in the morning. the lady at reception kind of just shrugs her shoulders and replies that it’s not their fault — which ticks me off into voicing my disagreement with that statement…to little avail as her reply is that “they were celebrating a wedding“.</description></item><item><title>gap of dunloe &amp; the lakes of killarney</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-17-gap-of-dunloe-the-lakes-of-killarney/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2009 18:26:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-17-gap-of-dunloe-the-lakes-of-killarney/</guid><description>breakfast today (we are still at the ballygarry house hotel) works out a bit better than yesterday: more coffee and tea available, no being told off for sitting at the wrong table. today’s program: by bus to the starting point of the pass up to the gap of dunloe, walk from there over the gap of dunloe and down to brandon’s cottage for a cup of tea, followed by a boat trip across the lakes of killarney to the town of killarney.</description></item><item><title>brandon’s well, an daingean peninsula</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-16-brandons-well-an-daingean-peninsula/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jul 2009 17:28:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-16-brandons-well-an-daingean-peninsula/</guid><description>around 2:00 in the morning: a group of hotel guests from that anniversary party very kindly let us in into their conversations they are having in the parking lot outside the hotel entrance — for about half an hour we get to share each and every attempt at jokularity… much appreciated.
at breakfast mrs d and i commit the faux pas of seating ourselves at one of the free tables as the large group table seems to be fully occupied.</description></item><item><title>a new breakfast beverage, brigid’s well, rock of cashel</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-15-a-new-breakfast-beverage-brigids-well-rock-of-cashel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2009 20:38:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-15-a-new-breakfast-beverage-brigids-well-rock-of-cashel/</guid><description>no “madame–baby” wake-up call this morning (i guess mr charming realized that madame was already taking a shower when he called) but a bit of re-packing before breakfast as today we are relocating to tralee in county kerry. having learnt from yesterday’s breakfast i appear on the scene 15min early and order coffee (for me) and tea (for mrs d) along with my cooked breakfast — ms rough charme tries to force me to use the german breakfast menu but i stubbornly insists on using the original.</description></item><item><title>oh, look, rain!…kevin’s way…glendalough</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-14-oh-look-rain-kevins-way-glendalough/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2009 20:19:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-14-oh-look-rain-kevins-way-glendalough/</guid><description>ring, ring — mrs d picks up the phone, it’s the 7:15 wake-up call and, as expected, nobody answers back. time to get up. ring, ring — mrs d picks up the phone yet again, this time round it’s the bloke from reception asking whether “madame is ok?”, madame affirms and receives a rather charming “ok, baby”. this somewhat incongruous start into our first day as pilgrims in ireland kind of forms the fabric of the day: it stays incongruous, constantly changing between dry and rather wet.</description></item><item><title>on an irish pilgrimage…</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-13-on-an-irish-pilgrimage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2009 20:27:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-13-on-an-irish-pilgrimage/</guid><description>the next 10 days we are taking part in a spiritual journey through ireland. really kind of a pilgrimage, a christian pilgrimage to be precise, by bus (not a lot of walking involved, unfortunately) to the places of the old, celtic irish church. the whole trip has been organized by the akademie st. paul — and it’s the first group trip of this kind that i’ve ever participated in and i’m not too sure whether it’s going to be to my liking.</description></item></channel></rss>
