at first i thought that it looks a bit weird, then i realized (and on my way home looked at the clouds with “different eyes”) that it does look like that.
the second one is a classical, an in-door shot in the church of the monastery of einsiedeln1:</description></item><item><title>world’s first twitter wallfahrt!</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-29-worlds-first-twitter-wallfahrt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2010 20:27:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-29-worlds-first-twitter-wallfahrt/</guid><description>9:10 — ms d and i arrive at einsiedeln railway station, all kitted out in our walking gear, ready to go. walking past the train we spot our fellow pilgrims. yep, pilgrims: we are on our way to the starting point of the world’s first twitter pilgrimage, the #twallfahrt1 from pfäffikon to einsiedeln. in the train we meet @decolores1, @konzertharfe, @sempreincorsaa also ready to go on the #twallfahrt. just before the train is about to depart at 9:13 we are joined at the last second by @abtmartin — good thing, too, as he is supposed to lead us on our pilgrimage i’m looking forward to the first twitter pilgrimage which is at the same time my first pilgrimage on foot (last year’s pilgrimage was by bus, which somehow gives it a different twist, i think).</description></item><item><title>kells, tara, airport, trinity college, chilling out</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-22-kells-tara-airport-trinity-college-chilling-out/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jul 2009 20:58:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-22-kells-tara-airport-trinity-college-chilling-out/</guid><description>the last day of our irish pilgrimage! after another good breakfast at the newgrange hotel we pack once more and enter our pilgrims bus — which this morning has grown in size: morris, our excellent driver, swapped our smaller bus yesterday evening for a bigger one as he’s going to pick up a group of 50 at dublin airport right after dropping us off.
the final “building blocks” of our pilgrimage are kells and the hill of tara.</description></item><item><title>a walk through pittoresque boyne valley, time travel, monasterboice, &amp; the hill of slane</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-21-a-walk-through-pittoresque-boyne-valley-time-travel-monasterboice-slaine/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2009 20:40:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-21-a-walk-through-pittoresque-boyne-valley-time-travel-monasterboice-slaine/</guid><description>mrs d and i slept surprisingly well this night, given the fact that one of the main thorough-fares passes the hotel just a couple of meters away.1 breakfast is efficient and good and the waitresses are actually quite friendly and even know about gluten-free food for mrs j.2
the weather has become rather irish: it’s raining when we set off for a walk in the boyne valley, and it’s treating us to several showers on the otherwise rather pittoresque walk.</description></item><item><title>the burren, limestone pavement, clonmacnoise, &amp; an almost secret birthday</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-20-limestone-pavement-an-almost-secret-birthday/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2009 20:21:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-20-limestone-pavement-an-almost-secret-birthday/</guid><description>after a rather good night and an equally good and relaxed breakfast1 at hotel doolin we pack once more and embark on the long trip across ireland, going from the atlantic west coast all the way to navan. the weather is not as good as it was yesterday with clouds covering most of the sky.
we don’t just go to navan directly but instead take the scenic route. our first stop is at burren national park, the smallest of the 6 national parks in ireland and part of the larger area the burren: a karst landscape exhibiting the typical karst limestone pavement and also host for a number of megalithic tombs and portal dolmens — rather impressive.</description></item></channel></rss>
