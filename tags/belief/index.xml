we don’t just go to navan directly but instead take the scenic route. our first stop is at burren national park, the smallest of the 6 national parks in ireland and part of the larger area the burren: a karst landscape exhibiting the typical karst limestone pavement and also host for a number of megalithic tombs and portal dolmens — rather impressive.</description></item><item><title>listowel, shannon river ferry, lahinch, sunday lunch, cliffs of moher, live music at doolin</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-19-listowel-shannon-river-ferry-lahinch-sunday-lunch-cliffs-of-moher-live-music-at-doolinrimage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jul 2009 21:25:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-19-listowel-shannon-river-ferry-lahinch-sunday-lunch-cliffs-of-moher-live-music-at-doolinrimage/</guid><description>it’s sunday. our last night at the ballygarry house hotel was quiet for a change, which is nice. also, as long as our group is having breakfast, we are spared the rather annoying radio blast.1
after breakfast mrs d and i pack our stuff and join the rest of the pilgrims in our pilgrims bus. the first stop today is in listowel — apparently the literary capital of ireland. our stop is short: mr tambour, our pilgrimage guide, as always, is extremely well prepared and we learn quite a bit about listowel and its literary sons and daughters — but also take a look at listowel’s racetrack during the bus ride from tralee to listowel a co-pilgrim mentioned that apparently writers with a residence in ireland would live tax-free: might that explain the relatively high percentage of writers in relation to the total population?</description></item><item><title>brendan’s chapel, an daingean, gallarus oratory, an inch of beach</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-18-brendans-chapel-an-daingean-gallarus-oratory-an-inch-of-beach/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2009 20:10:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-18-brendans-chapel-an-daingean-gallarus-oratory-an-inch-of-beach/</guid><description>our final full day at tralee and the ballygarry house hotel. tonight we are spared the noisy party guests, unfortunately other co-pilgrims are not so lucky, they suffer from a rather rowdy crowd leaving this night’s wedding party at about 4:00 in the morning. the lady at reception kind of just shrugs her shoulders and replies that it’s not their fault — which ticks me off into voicing my disagreement with that statement…to little avail as her reply is that “they were celebrating a wedding“.</description></item><item><title>gap of dunloe &amp; the lakes of killarney</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-17-gap-of-dunloe-the-lakes-of-killarney/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jul 2009 18:26:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-17-gap-of-dunloe-the-lakes-of-killarney/</guid><description>breakfast today (we are still at the ballygarry house hotel) works out a bit better than yesterday: more coffee and tea available, no being told off for sitting at the wrong table. today’s program: by bus to the starting point of the pass up to the gap of dunloe, walk from there over the gap of dunloe and down to brandon’s cottage for a cup of tea, followed by a boat trip across the lakes of killarney to the town of killarney.</description></item><item><title>a new breakfast beverage, brigid’s well, rock of cashel</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-15-a-new-breakfast-beverage-brigids-well-rock-of-cashel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2009 20:38:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-15-a-new-breakfast-beverage-brigids-well-rock-of-cashel/</guid><description>no “madame–baby” wake-up call this morning (i guess mr charming realized that madame was already taking a shower when he called) but a bit of re-packing before breakfast as today we are relocating to tralee in county kerry. having learnt from yesterday’s breakfast i appear on the scene 15min early and order coffee (for me) and tea (for mrs d) along with my cooked breakfast — ms rough charme tries to force me to use the german breakfast menu but i stubbornly insists on using the original.</description></item><item><title>oh, look, rain!…kevin’s way…glendalough</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-14-oh-look-rain-kevins-way-glendalough/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2009 20:19:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-14-oh-look-rain-kevins-way-glendalough/</guid><description>ring, ring — mrs d picks up the phone, it’s the 7:15 wake-up call and, as expected, nobody answers back. time to get up. ring, ring — mrs d picks up the phone yet again, this time round it’s the bloke from reception asking whether “madame is ok?”, madame affirms and receives a rather charming “ok, baby”. this somewhat incongruous start into our first day as pilgrims in ireland kind of forms the fabric of the day: it stays incongruous, constantly changing between dry and rather wet.</description></item><item><title>on an irish pilgrimage…</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-13-on-an-irish-pilgrimage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jul 2009 20:27:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-07-13-on-an-irish-pilgrimage/</guid><description>the next 10 days we are taking part in a spiritual journey through ireland. really kind of a pilgrimage, a christian pilgrimage to be precise, by bus (not a lot of walking involved, unfortunately) to the places of the old, celtic irish church. the whole trip has been organized by the akademie st. paul — and it’s the first group trip of this kind that i’ve ever participated in and i’m not too sure whether it’s going to be to my liking.</description></item></channel></rss>
