this year’s play is kino etzel — which @jmdhh and i went to see tonight.</description></item><item><title>some more pseudo HDR experiments</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-31-some-more-pseudo-hdr-experiments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2010 07:46:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-31-some-more-pseudo-hdr-experiments/</guid><description>during sunday’s #twallfahrt i managed to take a couple of 5-step bracketed pictures, two of which i think produced some interesting results. the first one is the view from etzel pass towards einsiedeln:
at first i thought that it looks a bit weird, then i realized (and on my way home looked at the clouds with “different eyes”) that it does look like that.
the second one is a classical, an in-door shot in the church of the monastery of einsiedeln1:</description></item><item><title>world’s first twitter wallfahrt!</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-29-worlds-first-twitter-wallfahrt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2010 20:27:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2010-08-29-worlds-first-twitter-wallfahrt/</guid><description>9:10 — ms d and i arrive at einsiedeln railway station, all kitted out in our walking gear, ready to go. walking past the train we spot our fellow pilgrims. yep, pilgrims: we are on our way to the starting point of the world’s first twitter pilgrimage, the #twallfahrt1 from pfäffikon to einsiedeln. in the train we meet @decolores1, @konzertharfe, @sempreincorsaa also ready to go on the #twallfahrt. just before the train is about to depart at 9:13 we are joined at the last second by @abtmartin — good thing, too, as he is supposed to lead us on our pilgrimage i’m looking forward to the first twitter pilgrimage which is at the same time my first pilgrimage on foot (last year’s pilgrimage was by bus, which somehow gives it a different twist, i think).</description></item><item><title>16:00 back in einsiedeln</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-06-01-1600-back-in-einsiedeln/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2009 20:34:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-06-01-1600-back-in-einsiedeln/</guid><description>at lucerne verkehrshaus i disembark one station earlier than planned, trying to catch the voralpenexpress train back to biberbrugg. with a bit of, let’s say, fast-hobbling i manage to catch the train and am on my way back home.
at biberbrugg i meet up with mrs d who has just been dropped of by fredi and is tired but happy from a fantastic day out. together we hop on to the train to einsiedeln and walk/hobble home picture links:</description></item><item><title>einsiedeln, 9:05</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-06-01-einsiedeln-905/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2009 07:05:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2009-06-01-einsiedeln-905/</guid><description>having hobbled to einsiedeln station, i’m in time for the 9:05 post bus to oberiberg — the weather is fantastic and i do envy mrs d for her snowshoe hike from the gotthard pass up to fibbia, a tour i’d been looking forward to very much1, especially as it is guided by fredi kälin from bluedimensions (if you want to do really nice walks or snowshoe tours: book fredi!)
instead of moapping around at home, however, i’ve planned a little mountain and lake tour myself — using only public transport i intend to go from einsiedeln via oberiberg to ibergeregg pass, have a coffee break there and enjoy the panorama, then on to the capital of our canton, schwyz.</description></item></channel></rss>
