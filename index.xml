‚Ä¶after about 20 years or so you&amp;rsquo;ve seen it all, done it all, tried it all, met all the script kiddies in your logs, evaded them by moving your SSH server port out of harm&amp;rsquo;s way (not that you were using password-based ssh accounts to begin with, it was just so annoying to see them try the same thing over and over again, no creativity really, come on‚Ä¶), dito for the attack attempts on your nginx server (again, easily foiled, by using a handful of fail2ban rules).</description></item><item><title>About‚Ä¶</title><link>https://d2h.net/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 19:07:17 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/about/</guid><description>Welcome to my blog, d2h.net.

In a nutshell Evan has set up a continuous integration chain for his hugo based website. The workflow is as follows:
create the new hugo post on whatever device you want commit the post and push to github github triggers the continuous integration service travis travis regenerates the static web site travis deploys the static web site Where Evan is using github, travis, and S3 I wanted to go the self-hosted route.</description></item><item><title>Full Circle</title><link>https://d2h.net/posts/2019-05-19-switching-to-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2019 16:53:29 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://d2h.net/posts/2019-05-19-switching-to-hugo/</guid><description>OK, I&amp;rsquo;m back to where I started, blog-wise: statically generated content.

The workflow is a bit different now from back then: content is contained in a self-hosted gitea instance, which is feeding into a self-hosted drone instance, all docker-ized.
